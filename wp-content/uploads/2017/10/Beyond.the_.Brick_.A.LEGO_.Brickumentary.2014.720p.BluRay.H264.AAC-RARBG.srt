6
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,290
太空
Space.

7
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,220
人类在其无垠的广阔里
Humankind has been gazing

8
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,250
已凝望了上千年
into its infinite vastness for millennia.

9
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,380
现在我们将人类的知识推到极限
Here we are pushing the boundaries of our knowledge,

10
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,140
进入冒险旅程
venturing out into...

11
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,640
什么 这些乐高迷你人偶在这里做什么
What? What are LEGO minifigures doing out here?

12
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,850
这些见鬼的玩具到底在外太空干什么呢
What the heck are toys doing in outer space?

13
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,560
要回答这个问题 就先要开始回到
To answer that, first we have to start our story

14
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,350
那美好古老星球--地球来讲我们的故事
back on good old planet Earth.

15
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,110
这里是美国西北的太平洋地区
Here in the U.S.'s Pacific Northwest,

16
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:13,600
一个叫托林的男孩
a boy named Thorin makes

17
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,240
正在为自己打造的战役场景做着最后一刻的准备
last-minute preparations on his battle scene.

18
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,990
在荷兰罗莎正在她的客厅里建造一辆小轿车
In the Netherlands, Rosa is building a car in her living room.

19
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,250
在中国的上海

20
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,960
雨航玩一套新的乐高套来庆祝他的生日

21
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,120
在科罗拉多州的丹佛
And in Denver, Colorado,

22
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,090
埃文像世界上许多人一样
Eben, like so many around the world,

23
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,670
正趴在他家客厅的地毯上玩乐高积木
is sprawled on his living room floor playing with LEGO bricks.

24
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,550
这是我们所期待的 对吗
This is what we expect, right?

25
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,100
毕竟 世界上约有五亿的人口是在乐高积木的陪伴下长大的
After all, around half a billion people grew up with LEGO bricks.

26
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,020
在这星球上 每个人可拥有超过100块的乐高积木
There are over 100 LEGO pieces for every person on the planet.

27
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,230
但是这个故事 但是 你在那能听到我吗
But this story... but... Can you hear me out there?

28
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,360
哇 这样好多了
There. That's better.

29
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,690
咋了 出了什么问题
What? What's wrong?

30
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,900
你为什么那样看着我  噢 噢
Why are you looking at me like that? Oh, oh.

31
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,700
这样吧 如何啦
There. How's that?

32
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,410
现在 我知道 我知道
Now, I know. I know.

33
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,080
你认识我 对吗
You recognize me, right?

34
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,410
没有特色却很实用的手
Featureless yet functional hands.

35
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,210
可更换的头发
Interchangeable hair.

36
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:13,380
完美的金色 呃 或者棕黄色吧 我猜
Perfect golden, uh, tan, I guess?

37
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,210
但是这个故事并不是关于我的 呃 至少不是全部
But this story's not about me. Well, not entirely.

38
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,550
这个故事是关于一种简单的玩具
This story is about a simple toy that became,

39
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,640
呃 但它后来却不仅仅是个玩具
well, more than a toy.

40
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,850
在创造力的新纪元 它独一无二的特性是如何
And how its unique properties ushered in a new era of creativity,

41
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,640
成为不仅仅是孩童 而是整整一代人的指引者
not just for kids, but for a whole generation.

42
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,730
这不仅仅是关于积木
This is about more than the brick.

43
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,150
它超越了--不 等一下
This is beyond the-- No, hang on a second.

44
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:44,010
乐高积木纪录片

45
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:42,110
超越了积木  一部乐高积木纪录片
Beyond the brick! A LEGO Brickumentary!

46
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,990
噢 看呐 真是酷炫
Ooh, look at that. That's awesome.

47
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,870
在纽约市一年一度的玩具展览会
At the annual Toy Fair in New York City,

48
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,500
全球的玩具制造商聚到一起来炫耀
the world's toy manufacturers gather to show off

49
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,960
那些为孩子打造的他们所希望成为的大产品
what they hope will be big products for kids.

50
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,260
乐高 让我们直说
LEGO is, let's face it,

51
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,550
主席 全球玩具专家

52
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,930
无疑是玩具工业中最出色的成功传奇
undoubtedly the greatest success story of the toy industry.

53
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,430
他们已成为世界第二大玩具公司
They have become the number two toy company

54
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:10,100
只推出一类简单的玩具 那就是建筑
with simply one category of toy, and that's construction.

55
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,000
玩具内幕妈妈

56
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:15,190
它与美泰和孩之宝这样的玩具巨头相抗衡
And that's up against giants like Mattel and Hasbro.

57
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,520
美泰有风火轮  还有芭比娃娃
Mattel has Hot Wheels. They have Barbie.

58
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,360
孩之宝有"特种部队"人偶玩具 还有其他产品
Hasbro has GI Joe. And they've got other lines.

59
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,660
但乐高公司只有乐高积木
And LEGO just has LEGO.

60
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,250
当其他玩具公司看待乐高时
When other toy companies look at LEGO,

61
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:29,400
编辑 《开玩了》杂志

62
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,740
他们讲它看作一个强大的集团
they look at them as a powerhouse.

63
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,950
当你看待一个价值四十亿美元的品牌
When you look at a four billion dollar brand

64
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,790
并且今年还将持续增长的品牌
and that's going to continue to grow this year,

65
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,670
就会惊讶他们的成就
it's amazing what they've done.

66
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,750
它已经成为玩具界的巨人品牌
It's become a monster brand of the toy business.

67
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,130
那么乐高公司是如何取得形成如此大的规模呢
So how did the LEGO company become so huge?

68
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,970
我可以解释 不过我想最好先把这部分搁置不提
I can explain that, but I think I better park this thing first.

69
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,930
认识这个宝贝吗
Recognize this baby?

70
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,730
是啊 优秀的老型号 编号497
Yeah, good old number 497.

71
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,400
星际开发者
Galaxy Explorer.

72
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,270
它有这些很酷的黄色小窗
It had these cool yellow-tinted windows,

73
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,740
所有这些2x2的计算机操作台积木
all these 2x2 computer bricks,

74
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,280
还有 呃 这些东西
and, uh, these things.

75
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,660
它只是一个乐高品牌魅力历史的一小部分
It's just a small part of the LEGO brand's fascinating history.

76
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,040
让我们用一点时间 来个小小启蒙导读 关于这款玩具的发轫
Let's take a moment for a little primer on how the toy began.

77
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,460
噢 不 等一下
Oh, no, wait a second.

78
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,420
开始吧 这样好多了
There we go. Much better.

79
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,880
很多人把丹麦
Many people know Denmark

80
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,420
视为待组装家具的故乡
as the home of ready-to-assemble furniture.

81
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,800
可悲的是 这些人错了 因为那是瑞典
Sadly, those people are wrong because that's Sweden.

82
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,640
丹麦是汉斯·克里斯汀·安徒生
Denmark is home to Hans Christian Andersen,

83
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,760
美味的甜点的故乡
delicious pastries,

84
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,810
和正如你会猜到的 乐高积木的出生地
and the birthplace of, you guessed it, LEGO bricks.

85
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:38,020
追溯至1916 一个叫欧拉·克里克·克里斯琴的丹麦人
Back in 1916, a Danish man by the name of Ole Kirk Christiansen

86
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:41,150
住在丹麦一座古色古香的小镇 比隆
lived in the quaint little town of Billund, Denmark.

87
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,380
是个做生意的木匠
A carpenter by trade, he started

88
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,410
他开的一家小的木屋商店在一场火灾中被夷为平地
a small wood shop which burned to the ground.

89
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,310
不是个很好的开端
Not a great start, but Ole

90
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,660
但欧拉并未退缩 又开了另外一家
would not be dissuaded, so he built another one.

91
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,370
在新的工厂里 他有了做搭建玩具的灵感
In the new factory, he was inspired to build toys.

92
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,730
到二十世纪三十年代
By the 1930s, Ole was

93
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,460
欧拉以他用桦木制作的拉拔式玩具而出名
known for his pull toys made from birch wood.

94
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,710
卡车 火车 当然还有鸭子
Trucks, trains, and of course ducks.

95
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,210
也就大约在这个时候 欧拉想出了乐高这个名字
It was around this time that Ole came up with the name LEGO.

96
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,050
它来自丹麦语短语leg godt 意为"好玩"
It comes from the Danish phrase leg godt, meaning "Play well."

97
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,760
然后这工厂再次被大火夷为平地
Then the factory burned down again.

98
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,060
但在欧拉的坚持下 它再次重建了
But with Ole's perseverance, it was rebuilt again,

99
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,440
这回最主要生产木制玩具
this time mostly for making wooden toys,

100
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,610
直到1947年的重大日子到来 欧拉去参观一个玩具市场
until a fateful day in 1947, when Ole was visiting a toy fair.

101
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,730
他遇到了一个新型装置 一个塑料模型机器
He came across a new contraption, a plastic molding machine.

102
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,780
欧拉带回了丹麦的第一台塑料模型机器
Ole brought the first one back to Denmark,

103
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,450
尽管不是所有人对它深刻印象
though not everyone was impressed.

104
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,530
起先 欧拉用他的手动模型机器
At first, Ole used his hand-powered molding machine

105
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,030
来制作简单的塑料玩具
to make simple plastic toys.

106
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,870
但后来他的儿子高梵想了一个很棒的点子
But then his son Godtfred had a brilliant idea.

107
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,740
我记得我父亲 对他来说
I remember my father, for him,

108
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,870
这个装置非常非常重要
the system was very, very important,

109
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,710
因为能把积木变成一套可玩的系统
to turn the bricks into a system of play.

110
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,750
老板 乐高集团

111
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,960
积木本身当然也是一个简单的结构
The brick in itself is, of course, a simple structure.

112
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:48,470
但用有限的积木 却能有无数的可能
But with the number of bricks, you have endless possibilities.

113
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,300
这个主意保留了下来 乐高玩具装置就此诞生
The idea stuck, and the LEGO system of play was born

114
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,810
并延续至今日
and continues to this day.

115
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,110
事实上 1955年制造的乐高积木
In fact, bricks made in

116
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,560
跟你在今天能买到的积木依然可以配套使用
1955 still work with bricks you can buy today.

117
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,540
积木的堆叠效果还不错
The bricks were great for stacking,

118
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,440
但仍有改进空间
but still had room for improvement.

119
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,440
克里斯琴的解决办法是改善抓合力
The Christiansen solution was clutch power.

120
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,940
什么是抓合力
What is clutch power?

121
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,950
抓合力就是用于把积木组合到一起的
Clutch power is the result of the patented studs and tubes design

122
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,530
钉纽和管状结构专利设计
that holds the bricks together.

123
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,580
也能让它们
And allows them to...

124
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:15,910
咻
...whew...

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,200
分开
come apart.

126
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:20,210
然后在1960年 这家工厂再次失火了
Then in 1960, the factory burned down again.

127
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,920
是~的~ 无论如何 它们到底是用什么建的这些工厂啊
Yeesh. What are they building these factories out of, anyway?

128
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,590
但是欧拉不管那讨厌的火灾 又回到了工作
But Ole went back to work, and despite those pesky fires,

129
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,130
他的公司继续发展壮大
his company continued to grow.

130
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,840
这个神奇的构件能够把相连接的积木
This magic formula of an ever-expanding system

131
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,890
无限扩大组合的一套装置 使得乐高玩具
with its locking bricks made LEGO toys

132
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:36,890
成为了吸引世界各地孩子们的神器
something that appealed to kids everywhere.

133
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:40,350
当一个丹麦人的努力成为了全球现象时 开启了什么呢
What started as a Danish endeavor became a global phenomenon.

134
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,980
公司继续发展壮大
Helping with this expansion of the company

135
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,900
是在其长孙凯尔的帮助下 你之前见过
was oldest grandson Kjeld, who you met before.

136
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,480
你可能在最早版本的包装盒上认出他
You might recognize him from some of the earliest boxes.

137
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,940
可爱的小帅哥
Cute kid.

138
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,950
就个人而言 我觉得凯尔在乐高的历史上做出的最大贡献
Personally, I feel Kjeld's greatest contribution to LEGO history

139
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:55,740
是他在乐高迷你人偶的发展中所扮演的角色
was his role in the development of LEGO minifigures, or minifigs.

140
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,040
嘿 伙计们 还没胳膊呢 哈?
Hey, guys, still no arms, huh?

141
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,500
几年下来 他们显然经过了设计上的改进
They obviously improved on that design over the years.

142
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,500
但真正让公司赢得更大成功的
But what really catapulted the company into greater success

143
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,300
是新的主题套装 比如城堡和太空
were the new theme sets, like Castle and Space.

144
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,050
后来是  授权主题比如星球大战
And later, licensed themes like Star Wars.

145
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,760
嘿 还有哈利波特
Hey! And Harry Potter.

146
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,430
哇 哇
Whoa, whoa.

147
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:18,180
哇 呀
Whoa! Yikes!

148
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,390
今天的乐高公司每分钟可生产超过十万件积木
Today the LEGO company makes more than 100, 000 pieces a minute,

149
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,730
已经成为世界上最大的玩具公司
and has become one of the biggest toy companies in the world.

150
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,820
但在其一路发展的过程中
But not without first experiencing some serious challenges

151
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,480
在重新定义自己方面仍要首次经历重大挑战
in having to redefine itself along the way.

152
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:30,690
我们稍后再说这个问题
But we'll get into that later.

153
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,430
只是想 所有这些
And just think, all this

154
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,450
来自于丹麦比隆的一个不起眼的木匠
from a humble carpenter in Billund, Denmark.

155
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,910
哦 抱歉
Ooh, sorry.

156
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,490
大概是因为没有抓合力 我想
No clutch power, I guess.

157
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,040
比隆依然是乐高公司的核心
Billund is still the heart of the LEGO company,

158
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,630
乐高迷你人偶仍然在这里制造
and LEGO minifigures are still made here.

159
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,630
英俊的小恶魔们 不是吗
Handsome little devils, aren't they?

160
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,590
好吧 那个镜头着实吓到了我
Okay, that shot kinda freaks me out.

161
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,550
比隆也是乐高设计团队的故乡
Billund is also home to the LEGO design team.

162
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,260
在这里 设计间内 未来的乐高套装
Here, inside the design room, the LEGO sets of tomorrow

163
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,560
正在现在被我们的设计师所构想着
are being dreamed up today by designers.

164
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,270
每个我遇到的员工都说
Everybody I meet says

165
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,720
乐高设计师

166
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,690
我有这世界上最酷的工作之一
that I have one of the coolest jobs in the world.

167
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:10,940
能创造这些积木真是太有意思了
It's fantastic to be able to create with these bricks.

168
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:10,940
乐高设计师

169
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,180
乐高设计师

170
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,150
我们的书桌永远摆满了乐高积木
We have our desks full of LEGO all the time.

171
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,570
好像我这辈子余下的时光都能当个孩子
It's like being a child for the rest of my life.

172
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,210
对很多人来说 搭建乐高积木时
For many, the only limitation

173
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,830
唯一的局限是你的想象力
of building with LEGO bricks is your imagination.

174
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,910
但对于乐高公司的设计师们来说
But for the designers at the LEGO company,

175
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,120
这是一个要严密得多的过程
it's a much more regimented process.

176
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,050
乐高设计师

177
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,630
我们一直在这些乐高积木的体系内
We're always working within a system based on

178
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,920
进行创造工作
these LEGO bricks here.

179
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,590
其可能性并不是无穷无尽的
There's not an infinite amount of possibility.

180
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:35,680
如果你愿意 这些限制也可以成为挑战
The constraints becomes the challenge, if you will.

181
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:35,750
乐高设计师

182
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,390
后来 正是这些限制给了我们
Then it's those constraints that are interesting

183
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:41,930
找到奏效方案的有趣灵感
to find how do we make it work.

184
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,850
你不得不去思考孩子们怎样玩乐高
You have to think about how kids play with LEGO,

185
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,450
乐高设计师

186
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,400
这也是我们脑中一直在设想的
which is something that we always have in our minds.

187
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,400
如果你今年五岁 那用这些小积木搭建东西
If you're five years old, it's a lot harder to build

188
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,530
要比对一个八岁的孩子来说难得多
with smaller bricks than it is for an eight-year-old.

189
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,900
设计流程中的核心是一个指导性的原则
At the core of the design process is one guiding principal.

190
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,220
设计的流程真正开始于
The design process really

191
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:59,450
宇宙中的一个故事
starts with an idea of a story in a universe.

192
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,040
我们真正地把这些人物作为切入点
We really take a starting point in who these characters are,

193
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,160
他们住在哪儿 他们做些什么
where they're living, what they're doing.

194
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,670
故事提供给你做事的背景
Story provides context for what you're doing.

195
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,500
它给你和孩子们一个特定的意义
It gives you and kids especially a meaning.

196
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:15,380
某种意义上它帮助他们以全新的方式展开想象力
It sort of helps to unlock their imagination in new ways.

197
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,590
我们就是试图
We were just trying to put

198
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,800
将我们从未用过的颜色组合搭配在一起
together color combinations we haven't done before.

199
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:22,350
詹米·贝拉尔德是公司里的设计明星之一
Jamie Berard is one of the company's design stars.

200
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:25,390
他是专业建筑物系列的创意领队
He's the creative lead for the expert building series.

201
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,980
今天他正在给他的上司展示他新的巴黎式小餐馆的模型
Today he's showing his boss his new Parisian cafe model

202
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,480
这模型即将公开面世
which will be revealed to the public soon.

203
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:35,780
我在乐高积木展上最希望出彩的是讲述故事场景
What I really hope to highlight at BrickCon is the storytelling.

204
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,530
举个例子 这个阳台上的男士
For example, the gentleman on the balcony

205
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,030
其实准备了一个小惊喜
has actually got a little bit of a surprise,

206
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,080
手里拿着一个戒指
and he's got this ring in his hand.

207
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,580
那会帮助他顺利地和女友结为连理
That will help him hopefully marry his girlfriend.

208
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,200
这份工作 实在是太赞了
The job, it's amazing.

209
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:52,070
乐高设计师

210
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,370
我并不想过分吹嘘 你知道
I don't want to oversell it that, you know,

211
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:52,170
周二有数不清的巧克力牛奶以及按摩福利
there's rivers of chocolate milk and massages on Tuesdays.

212
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,170
你知道 这是一份工作 但它是一份太棒的工作
You know, it's a job. But it's an amazing job.

213
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,340
你可能会好奇 例如 它能持续多久
You almost wonder, like, how long can this last?

214
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,590
这是真的吗
Is this for real?

215
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,250
恩菲尔德 康涅狄格州

216
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,190
另一份在乐高公司让人梦寐以求的工作
Another coveted job at

217
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,390
是搭建专家
the LEGO company is that of master builder.

218
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,020
像设计师一样 搭建专家们
Like the designers, master builders are, well,

219
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,520
对于搭建乐高积木非常精通
masters at building with LEGO bricks.

220
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,610
但他们要想的是包装盒以外的东西
But they get to think outside the box.

221
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,600
所以作为一个搭建专家
So as a master builder, we get

222
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,990
模型展示设计师

223
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,820
我们要做出能制成我们模型的任何东西
to do everything it takes to make our models,

224
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,200
我们要设计模型 我们会做一个很好的组合体
we design models, we do a pretty good mixture.

225
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,120
每件作品都是从微小的模型做起
We do everything from little tiny models,

226
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,330
搭建人物也是如此
all the way up to human beings.

227
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,670
它总会是与众不同的
It's always going to be different.

228
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,630
每个模型的姿势都是挑战
Every model poses its own challenge.

229
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,340
有时是模型的庞大的体积
Sometimes it's the sheer size of the models.

230
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,670
最终 在最后的一天结束
Ultimately, at the end of the day,

231
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,170
你真的就是做到了能用乐高所做的极限
it's really just pushing the bounds of what you can do with LEGO,

232
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,430
有创造力 有艺术性 还有所有这些惊人的作品
being creative and being artistic and all these amazing things.

233
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,180
今天 搭建大师们在致力于一个庞大的工程
Today, the master builders are working on a huge project

234
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,770
将会被全世界所观赏
that'll be seen all over the world:

235
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,480
那就是为乐高电影的布景
the setting for The LEGO Movie.

236
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,900
为乐高工作最好的事情就是
The nicest thing about working for LEGO is that

237
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,900
我们有我们所需要的全部构件
we have all of the pieces we need.

238
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:58,920
乐高搭建专家

239
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:01,780
这是绝大多数人梦寐以求的
It's something that most people would just dream of.

240
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,580
在这座特殊的乐高城里  我就这么坐下来
For this particular city, I got to sit down and

241
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,080
定购任何我想要的东西
order whatever I wanted.

242
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,670
至于电影的情节
As far as the plot of the movie,

243
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,920
我真的不知道太多
I really don't know a lot about it.

244
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,470
唔  其实有很多东西
Um, there's a lot more than

245
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,800
远不止是电影里即将上演的
just this that's going to be in this movie,

246
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,590
我们在同一时间里努力着
that we're all working on at the same time.

247
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,930
这是一份有纪念意义的事业
And it's a monumental undertaking.

248
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,930
几周后 他们的乐高城抵达了
Weeks later, their LEGO city arrives

249
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:33,980
然后被保罗的团队在洛杉矶的摄影棚中重新组合
and is reassembled by Paul's team on a soundstage in Los Angeles.

250
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,400
它作为现场拍摄的序列布景
It serves as the setting for the live action sequences

251
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,360
在威尔·法瑞尔的地下室里
in Will Ferrell's basement.

252
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,650
好了 请无关人员离场
Okay, clearing guys, please.

253
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,780
开拍
Action.

254
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,160
是啊 这有些疯狂 我们已经
Yeah, it's been kind of crazy, we've had, uh,

255
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,990
我们拍摄实景电影已经五天了
we're shooting for five days of live action

256
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,990
这部电影基本是动画的
and the movie's mostly animated.

257
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,210
我们搭建了滑稽的乐高模型作为背景
And we've built this ridiculous LEGO model back there.

258
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,190
乐高电影编剧/导演

259
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,330
我们自己搭建了它
We built it ourselves.

260
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,170
亲自地 只用我们的双手
Personally, with our bare hands.

261
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,750
事实上 我们有一个超级的搭建能手团队
Actually, we had a team of super master builders.

262
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,460
它看起来非常出色
And it turned out pretty awesome.

263
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,880
非常喜剧化
It's pretty ridiculous.

264
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,840
这些人在康涅狄格州为此已经忙碌了
These guys have been working on it in Connecticut

265
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,100
大概 三个月了
for, like, three months.

266
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,010
然后 当然 我们做的第一件事是来
And then, of course, the first thing we do is go,

267
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,270
好吧 我们要推倒所有这些
okay, we're going to smash all of this.

268
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:14,890
所以 这是座城 是某种意义上的城堡世界
So there's a city, there's sort of a castle world

269
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,690
我们称它为中西兰岛
that we're calling Middle Zealand.

270
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,690
那有一艘海盗船
There's a pirate ship.

271
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:22,280
一些经典的太空的东西来自79年的系列
Some classic space stuff from '79.

272
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,530
听说我们会得到一些免费的乐高玩具
We heard we would get some free LEGOs.

273
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:30,120
耶 我在一块一块地组装一架经典宇宙船
Yeah! I'm literally doing this for one classic space ship.

274
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,910
嘿 菲尔  你的人给我的人打电话
Hey, Phil, have your people call my people,

275
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,750
我们搭伙吧 一起吃午饭怎么样
we'll hook you up. Maybe we can do lunch?

276
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,670
这部电影的布置给人印象非常深刻
So, this movie set is pretty impressive.

277
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,710
但是捷克的搭建专家
But the master builders in the Czech Republic

278
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,630
在致力于一个甚至更大的工程
are working on even bigger things.

279
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,000
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h乐高工厂
克拉德诺 捷克共和国

280
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,850
在克拉德诺(捷克地名) 我们为乐高乐土主题公园
In Kladno, we produce big models

281
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:55,100
和乐高市场在制造大型模型
for LEGOLAND parks and for LEGO markets.

282
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,440
我们有好多不同的东西可以做
There's a lot of different stuff we can do.

283
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,530
人们不知道的是 我们有计算机程序
What people don't know is we have computer programs

284
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,010
产品经理 乐高公司

285
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,950
在模型搭建者观察图层的部分
where model builders see the layers.

286
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,450
并非每块积木都是可视的
There is not visible every single brick.

287
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,950
内部还有钢质结构的部分
There is steel construction inside.

288
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:17,290
我们期待着至今我们所建造的最大工程
We are looking forward to the biggest project we've ever built.

289
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:20,080
这是保密的 应该没有人知道这个项目
It's secret. Nobody should know about the project.

290
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,800
就是那里 这是交界面
So there, this is the interface.

291
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,960
和亚罗米尔一起为秘密建筑工作的
Working with Jaromir on the secret build

292
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,590
美国项目经理戴尔·切斯
is American project manager Dale Chasse.

293
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,970
好吧 所以我们要把所有这些东西从毫米换算成英寸
Okay, so we'll convert all this stuff from millimeters to inches.

294
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,230
现在我的手头有着最有意思的工程
I have the most interesting project on my plate right now,

295
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:37,880
项目主管 乐高公司

296
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,500
比我和乐高公司合作了21年以来
than I've had in the whole

297
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,600
所有的项目都更有趣
21 years that I've been with the LEGO company.

298
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,390
我们在秘密地设计
We're secretly designing

299
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:43,360
和搭建一个真实大小的X翼星战战机
and building an X-Wing fighter, life size.

300
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,570
而这个项目真正酷的地方在于
But what's really cool about this project is

301
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,410
我们在复制一个其实你可以在商店里买到的我们的产品
we're copying one of our sets that you can actually buy in store.

302
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:53,740
这其实是它的构件序号 9493
It's actually the item number, 9493.

303
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,790
你可以自己在家里组装一个
And you can build this set at home.

304
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:00,460
而我们做到的是建造一个比它大42倍的模型
But what we've done is we've built it 42 times bigger than this.

305
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,340
这将会成为有史以来搭建的最大的乐高模型
This is going to be the biggest LEGO model ever built.

306
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,720
我们甚至无法相信这会成为现实
Even we can't believe this will be a reality.

307
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,050
我们有个庞大的团队
We have a big team here.

308
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,640
这是设计者 这是技术开发员
There is a designer, there is technical developer,

309
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,140
那是模型搭建者和机械师的团队
and there is team of model builders and mechanics.

310
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,400
我们工作程序的开始就是设计
The beginning of our process is design.

311
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,110
然后是技术开发
Then in technical development,

312
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,900
这是关于设计内部钢质结构的部分
it's about designing internal steel construction.

313
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,610
我们面前有很多挑战
We have a lot of challenges in front of us.

314
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,160
我们没有太多的时间分给每个单一的步骤
We don't have much time for every single step.

315
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,450
它将会用掉八吨的乐高积木
There will be eight tons of bricks used.

316
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,120
因此他们必须为我们
So they have to produce the

317
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,700
在比隆接连生产好几周的积木
bricks for us for a couple weeks in Billund.

318
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,120
太疯狂了
It's crazy.

319
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:27,000
X翼战机从机翼尖端到尖端的距离是44英尺
The X-Wing is 44 feet from wing tip to wing tip.

320
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,960
从头到尾有45英尺
It's 45 feet from bow to stern.

321
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,010
有11英尺高
It's 11 feet tall.

322
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,050
重44000磅
It weighs 44,000 pounds.

323
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,220
花费一万七千个小时用于建造
And took 17,000 hours to build.

324
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:42,640
最终 这个X翼战机模型准备好要跨越大西洋了
Finally, the X-Wing model is ready to cross the Atlantic,

325
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,650
在那里将继续它的冒险
where its adventure will continue.

326
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,980
但我们等会儿再回到这个故事
But we'll get back to that later.

327
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,240
我要把这些积木挨个捡起来
I'm gonna pick up the pieces

328
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,240
搭建一个乐高房子
And build a LEGO house

329
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:01,370
如果事情搞糟 我们能将它推倒
If things go wrong we can knock it down

330
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,040
乐高绝对是我童年的一部分 它是 嗯
LEGO was definitely part of my childhood, it was, uh...

331
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:09,650
艾德·希兰

格莱美提名歌手/作曲者

332
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,710
我和我哥哥有一个大盒子装着所有的东西
Me and my brother had a big box filled with everything,

333
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,460
是从我父母那里传下来的
um, just passed down from my parents.

334
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,420
但更多的是零碎的块 而非成套的模型
But it was more of the blocks rather than the sets.

335
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,550
任何时候我们组装一套
And any time we'd get a set,

336
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,010
它都挺像那些小东西的其中一个
it would be like one of the small ones.

337
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,680
而你永远都在盯着一套大的
And you'd always look at the big kits

338
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,550
在商店里可能就像这样 噢 我想要那个
in the shops and be like, "Oh, I want that."

339
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,010
然后只要有钱进账 我就像这样
And as soon as I came into money, I was like,

340
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,310
我要买什么呢 房子 不 车子 不 乐高
"What should I buy? House? Nah. Car? Nah. LEGO."

341
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:26,350
我的专辑一周内销量超五十万 然后我想要想法儿来庆祝一下
My album went gold in a week, and I wanted a way to celebrate.

342
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,270
我买的第一个东西就是死亡星际的乐高模型
The first thing that I bought was the Death Star.

343
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,150
它能做到的最主要的一件事是
The main thing that it does is it,

344
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:33,150
为你带回来一部分你的童年
it brings out a bit of your childhood.

345
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,110
而能够不忘记童年是很重要的
Which is important not to forget as well.

346
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,410
你明白  能让生活不那么严肃是件好事情
You know, it's good not to take life too seriously.

347
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:41,370
长大后 乐高对我来说更像这个
Growing up, LEGOs was more like this to me.

348
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:44,250
它更像一个 你知道 一个充满乱码的二进制文件
It was more, you know, the bin of chaos.

349
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,750
我就觉得  噢 不 谁会 为什么你要让乐高积木们知道
I was like, "Oh, no, who would-- why would you get LEGOs

350
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,530
《南方公园》创作人

351
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,670
要它们会被怎样组到一起呢
to be told how to put them together?"

352
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,880
就像 我总是认为它是一个非常有创意的东西
Like, I always thought it was a very creative thing.

353
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,760
然后我 我想我在南方公园大概制作到第二或第三季时
And then I, I think I rediscovered LEGOs

354
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,050
重新找到了乐高
right around the second or third season of South Park.

355
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,050
身边的人不会常相伴 喧嚣始终上演
People would walk in while chaos was going on,

356
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,100
我则会 只是把这些东西组合到一起
and I'd just be putting together these things.

357
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,600
而且我想 就像说明手册中介绍的那样
And I think that having that instruction book that said,

358
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,190
这一个在那一个的上面 然后这一个在那一个上面
this one on top of that one. And this one on that one.

359
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,610
对我来说这真是太治愈系了
It was just so therapeutic for me

360
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,060
因为我生命接下来的部分就是
because the rest of my life was,

361
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,730
想出一些东西 想出一些东西
think of something, think of something.

你知道 保持创意 保持创意 保持创意

00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:49,330
你想要买的话就要花4或5美元
And you wanna go buy it, you're gonna spend $4 or $5 for it.

437
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:52,790
所以乐高公司是怎么看待这些的呢
So what does the LEGO company make of all of this?

438
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,500
我们有点吃惊
We were kind of shocked.

439
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:57,290
这一切是基于用户想要做的
This is all based on what they want to do.

440
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,420
也是他们想要构建的
It's things they want to make.

441
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,880
这是他们想要组织的活动
It's events they want to organize.

442
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,940
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h高级主管
乐高社区活动参与

443
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,800
我们完全没计划过那些情况
We hadn't planned that.

444
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,680
这是超过我们所控制的
It's out of our control.

445
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:12,120
相扑大战

446
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,210
速度比赛

447
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,920
划船比赛

448
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,800
袋子中建模

449
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,240
完成
Done!

450
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,280
2 1 开始
Two, one, start.

451
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,500
盲建

452
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,660
在这里  我找到了
There it is. I found it.

453
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,000
-不  不是那个  -不 绝对是
- No, no. That's not it. - No, it's definitely it.

454
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,710
很多会展上
A familiar face at many

455
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:43,380
出现的一张熟悉的面孔是乐高设计师詹米·贝拉尔德
conventions is LEGO Designer Jamie Berard.

456
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,960
记得他吗
Remember him?

457
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:46,970
杰米在乐高的职业生涯是以一名乐高粉开始的
Jamie's LEGO career started as an AFOL.

458
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,340
我当时在一家玩具店
I was just at a toy store,

459
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,850
我看见很多成人聚集在乐高产品的过道旁
and I see all these adults in the LEGO aisle.

460
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,600
我当时想 这真奇怪
And I'm thinking, this is a bit odd.

461
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,060
因为我平常都是等到孩子们都走了
'Cause I'm used to normally waiting until the kids leave

462
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,890
才过去快速地瞥一眼
and then I can come over and take a quick peek

463
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,600
假装是给别人买
and pretend I'm shopping for someone.

464
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,510
这些人在那里聊天
These guys are hanging out talking,

465
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,230
各自炫耀他们的乐高套装
and they're showing off the sets,

466
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,230
然后一个套装买五份
and they're buying five copies of a set.

467
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,280
我当时想 我也会这么做!
And I'm like, I do that!

468
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,820
你们是干什么的  你们是谁
What do you... Who are you guys?

469
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,780
然后他们说 "我们有个俱乐部  你想来参加吗"
And they said, "Yeah, we have a club. Would you like to join?"

470
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,990
所以那真是一个很酷的时刻
And so it was actually this really cool moment where I...

471
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,540
我根本不知道它的存在 然而它找到了我
I didn't even know it was there and then it kind of found me.

472
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,870
杰米的生活在凯尔·克里斯汀安森和
Jamie's life changed when Kjeld Kristiansen

473
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,630
其他乐高高管们参观一次会展上看到了他的作品后发生了变化
and other LEGO executives visited a convention and saw his work.

474
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,880
所有的乐高高层们同时在一个地方出现
All these LEGO people that I never imagined I'd ever meet

475
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,720
这是我从来不敢想象的
were all in one place at one time,

476
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,140
当他们看到我建造的建筑物时
and saw all the stuff I was building

477
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,760
就来和我谈话
and started having a conversation with me,

478
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,260
问一些奇怪的问题
asking curious questions like,

479
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,140
比如"你有没有想过在海外工作"
"Have you ever thought of working overseas?"

480
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,930
然后他给我他的名片
And then he hands me his business card

481
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,850
然后说 "我很乐意继续这场谈话
and says, "I'd like to continue this conversation

482
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,310
在我回到丹麦后"
when I get back to Denmark."

483
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,080
接着他真的这么做了 我拿到了实习机会
And then... he did, and I got an internship,

484
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,550
然后我拿到了这份工作
and then I got the job.

485
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,610
我认为去乐高盛会是一件很酷的事情
I think it's awesome when I go to the LEGO events

486
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,590
产品设计经理
建造师
产品&市场研发部门

487
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,070
因为在很多程度上有些事情并没有变
because, in many ways, some things haven't changed at all.

488
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,700
我任然保持那份好奇心
I still have that curiosity.

489
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,580
我等不及去看大家的作品
I just can't wait to see what everybody's built,

490
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,660
去见到那些熟悉的面孔 那些和我一起玩的人
to see the old faces, people that I've hung out with.

491
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,620
这很有趣  大家看到我都是发自内心的快乐
It's just fun. People seem genuinely happy to see me.

492
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,840
我也很热爱的一个事实是
And I love the fact that

493
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,920
我还能感觉到自己是社团的一员
I still feel like I'm part of the community.

494
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:09,970
我是个彻彻底底的乐高成人粉  我不喜欢一些称呼
I'm a complete AFOL. I hate the term, because, like,

495
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:12,590
比如星舰迷和神秘博士迷能起这些酷酷的名字
Trekkies and Whovians get these cool handles.

496
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:14,120
乐高成人粉丝

497
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,050
而我们只用首字母略缩词
We have to use an acronym.

498
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,640
我建造来自大荧屏和小荧屏
I build characters from the big screen and the small screen,

499
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:22,440
电动游戏和网络文化里的角色
from video games and from Internet culture and memes.

500
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,560
我第一个作品是史蒂芬·霍金模型
The first one was my Stephen Hawking model,

501
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:27,070
这个模型出乎意料地火了
which unexpectedly went viral.

502
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:28,380
那时我才意识到
And that's when I realized

503
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,610
乐高创作有着更多的受众
there was a larger audience for LEGO creations.

504
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,900
我很期待和我的乐高好友们
I'm most looking forward

505
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,320
重聚一堂
to connecting with all my LEGO buddies again.

506
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,410
我们将会看到所有我们创造的
Uh, we get to see all the new things

507
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,620
新的作品  这是一场表演
that we've created. It's putting on a show.

508
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,710
对于像我这样的书呆子
And for a nerd like me,

509
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:46,750
你不是经常能有这样展示的机会
it's not often you get a chance to put on a show.

510
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,340
所以你想好要去乐高积木展带什么了吗
So, did you figure out what you're bringing to BrickCon?

511
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:53,340
想好了 我会带闹鬼的玩偶之家
Yeah, I think I'm going to bring the Haunted Doll House.

512
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,760
我们俩都像小孩一样迷乐高
We both were into LEGO as kids.

513
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:58,260
我们谈恋爱的时候并没有意识到
We didn't realize it when we started dating.

514
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,350
直到我们结婚搬到一起
And when we got married and moved into the house,

515
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,770
戴夫的妈妈打电话说 "过来拿你的东西"
Dave's mom called and said, "Come get your stuff."

516
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:05,770
在那堆东西中 我们发现了一大浴缸的乐高
In that stuff, we found a huge tub of LEGO.

517
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,860
我们一天晚上坐下来开始建造
We sat down one evening and started building.

518
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,930
我们一起玩然后
So, yeah, we did that and

519
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:10,820
发现俩人一起玩乐高好玩多了
found out it was a lot of fun to build together.

520
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,190
-没错  -我们真的很享受
- Yeah. - And we really enjoyed it.

521
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,820
我趋向于建很多蒸汽朋克的东西
I tend to build a lot of steampunk creations.

522
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:18,660
我喜欢蒸汽朋克的典雅
I just like the elegance of steampunk.

523
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,500
我趋向于关注小细节和内饰
I tend to focus more on the small details and interiors.

524
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,540
你也很热衷迷你人
You're also really big on minifigs.

525
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,250
没错 我是很喜欢
Yes. I do like minifigs.

526
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,380
很明显我们得把那辆车拆下来
Well, obviously we're gonna have to take the car down.

527
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,170
乐高会展上的大玩笑是1x5
The big joke at LEGO conventions is the 1x5.

528
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,970
呃 对于你们不了解1x5是什么的人
And uh, for those of you that don't know what a 1 x5 is...

529
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:37,890
那是在乐高社区对于一个漂亮女孩的代号
That is a guy code in the LEGO community for a hot girl.

530
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:40,970
因为乐高不制造1x5的砖块
And, it's because LEGO doesn't make a 1x5.

531
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:44,520
很多年前 出现在会展上的漂亮女孩是稀有物
Years ago, hot girls at conventions were a rarity.

532
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,730
但是 我很幸运有了自己的1x5 所以我满足了
But, you know, luckily I have my 1x5, so I'm all good.

533
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:57,950
我对于玩乐高的成人的解读是他们只是高个儿儿童
My definition of adults that play with LEGOs are just tall kids.

534
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,630
我喜欢建造 但我不是最好的建造者
I like to build, but I'm not the best builder.

535
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,840
你知道谁是最好的建造者吗
Do you wanna know who the best builder is?

536
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,210
我妈妈
My mom.

537
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:18,050
我在搭建最后几棵桦树马上完工
I'm finishing up just the last few of the birch trees

538
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,260
在图书馆的后面
here behind the library.

539
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:24,930
这棵在瑞文戴尔中间
And, uh, it's in the middle of Rivendell.

540
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:28,440
我们很兴奋这个即将完工
And we're really excited about finishing it,

541
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,310
但我们也有点吃惊
but we're also a little

542
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:33,820
它最后完工的样子真的好大
bit surprised at how big it turned out to be.

543
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,010
当你在每次只拼凑一个部分时
You never quite know when

544
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,780
你不会了解成品会有多震撼
you're working on one section at a time,

545
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,740
直到你把所有部件拼到一起
until you put it all together.

546
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,950
我几年前才开始重新玩乐高
I just started building again a couple years ago

547
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,290
那时我儿子对乐高积木表示有兴趣
when my son was getting interested in building.

548
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,790
我们就弄两节长吧
Let's make it only two segments long.

549
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:48,920
为什么
Why?

550
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,500
我们不想让它太宽
Because we don't want it to be too wide,

551
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,590
因为这个紧挨着岩石
'cause it's up next to rocks.

552
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:54,260
我从在家洗衣服的家庭主妇变成
I went from doing laundry one day

553
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:58,010
网络相簿上有超过两百五十万点击量的博主
to having over two and a half million hits on my Flickr pages.

554
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,720
这其实挺让人喘不过气的
And it was pretty overwhelming.

555
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,560
连续两年 Alice的作品都获得
For two years in a row, Alice's work has received

556
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,680
由会展访客评选的令人梦寐以求的人民选择奖
the coveted People's Choice Award from convention goers.

557
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:09,940
今年她建造的是一个瑞文戴尔的大型模型
This year she's built an enormous model of Rivendell,

558
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,060
来自电影指环王里的虚构城市
the mythic city from The Lord of the Rings.

559
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,230
我认为大家会喜欢的
I think people are going to like it.

560
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,150
我认为不会有相似的模型出现在会展
I don't think that there's anything quite like it.

561
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:22,320
我最喜欢做的事情之一是在会展上
One of my favorite things to do in a convention is

562
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:24,080
鼓励女孩们来玩乐高
to encourage the girls to build.

563
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,120
乐高一直是把焦点放在男孩身上
LEGO has historically really been focused on boys.

564
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,120
他们也承认自己
And they have admitted they

565
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,380
只面向一半的人口
have only been addressing half the population.

566
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,340
乐高现在认真对待这个问题了
They're now taking it seriously.

567
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:40,380
我认为目前还有很多未开发的
I think there's a tremendous world of possibilities

568
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:43,260
超多的可能性
that has been untapped so far.

569
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,720
有很多女孩走到我面前说
There are lots of girls who come up and say,

570
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,770
"谢谢你树立一个榜样"
"Thank you for being a role model."

571
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,020
拉起吊桥
Raise the drawbridge!

572
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,400
装载上飞牛弹弓
Load the "Cattle-pults"!

573
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,690
放出猎犬
Release the hounds!

574
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,440
哦 你们好
Oh! Hi, guys.

575
00:26:58,490 --> 00:26:59,540
正如你所见
As you can see, people

576
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,700
人们用乐高砖块建造出各种各样的东西
build all sorts of things out of LEGO bricks.

577
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:05,200
人们想出的组合几乎是无穷无尽的
The combinations people come up with, it's almost infinite.

578
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:09,250
等一下 我想知道是不是无限的  嘿
Wait a minute, I wonder if it is infinite. Hey!

579
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:12,750
在丹麦有一个人想要解决这个问题
There's a guy in Denmark trying to figure that out.

580
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:19,130
我要谈论一些关于乐高排列的
I'm going to talk about things that we know about

581
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,760
数字增长的事情
the growth of the number of LEGO configurations.

582
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,970
我叫索伦· 艾勒斯我是一名数学教授
My name is Soren Eilers. I'm a professor of mathematics.

583
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,250
数学系
哥本哈根大学 丹麦

584
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,970
一切都起始于乐高乐园
It all started in LEGOLAND, actually.

585
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,560
那是丹麦夏天雨季的一天
It was one of those rainy days in Danish summer,

586
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,230
我和我的女儿在一起
and I was there with my daughter.

587
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,980
索伦看到一个展品展示了
Soren saw a display dedicated to the original patent

588
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,820
由奥勒的儿子戈弗雷申请的原始专利
filed by Ole's son, Godtfred.

589
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,280
戈弗雷被专利局问到
Godtfred was asked by the patent officer,

590
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,950
"你能有多少种拼起六块砖块的方法"
"How many ways can you put together six of these bricks?"

591
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,450
然后他说 大概是 我们还在研究
And he says, something like, "We're still working on it,

592
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:52,410
但是当我出门的时候 我们已经算出102,981,000种 这种话
but when I left home, we had 102,981,000,"

593
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,920
反正就是这意思吧
or something like that.

594
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,210
所以我开始好奇他们怎么计算出这个数字的
And so I was wondering how they computed that number

595
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:59,590
因为看起来这是一个数学难题
because it seemed to be a difficult mathematical problem.

596
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:02,880
乐高做的只是数叠罗汉
What LEGO had done was to just count the-- the towers

597
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:05,180
就是把砖块叠起来
where you put the things on top of each other.

598
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:08,760
然而如果我有个建筑是有点矮而宽的
Whereas if I have a building that is sort of low and wide,

599
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:11,180
我最终有很多选择
I have a lot of options for the final one.

600
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:15,100
当然我有试着用理论推翻
Of course I tried to attack this with theory,

601
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:16,940
但是我没有任何进展
but I didn't get anywhere.

602
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,240
本质上 我能想到
So, essentially, all that

603
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,280
能做的就是求助计算机
I could think of doing was ask a computer.

604
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,030
事实上我的程序非常的低效率
In fact my program was very inefficient.

605
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:25,030
花了我一周才算出这个数字
Took me a week to compute this number.

606
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,950
正确的数字相当的大
The correct number is quite a lot higher.

607
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:34,370
正确答案是915,103,765
The correct number is 915, 103,765.

608
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,460
但是一旦索伦算出了结果 一个显而易见的问题是
But once Soren had the number, the obvious question was,

609
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,550
如果你加第七块砖块呢
what happens if you add a seventh brick?

610
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,220
或者第八块
Or an eighth?

611
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:47,970
算到五很容易
So it's pretty easy to count all the way to five.

612
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:52,180
六的话 我可以在五分钟内验算这个数字
Six, I can now recompute this number maybe in five minutes or so.

613
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:56,310
然后每次要花一百倍以上
And then each time it takes about a hundred times more.

614
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,360
下一次是几小时
So, next time it's a couple of hours.

615
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,150
算到八花了我将近五百小时
Counting eight it took me something like 500 hours.

616
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,780
如果我要算九或是十
So if I was to count with nine or ten...

617
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:09,280
可能要花费数年 也许数百年
This would probably take years, maybe hundreds of years.

618
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,000
这个未解的问题能说明关于乐高系统的什么呢
So what does this unsolvable problem say about the LEGO system?

619
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,630
用数学来定义就是它是个有限的系统
By mathematical definition, this is a finite system.

620
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,840
砖块的数量是有限的
We have a finite number of bricks.

621
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:24,760
螺柱和小洞的数字是有限的
They have a finite number of studs and holes.

622
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,300
但对于有实际目的的人们来说
But for all practical human purposes,

623
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:30,260
这些砖块却是无限灵活的
these bricks are infinitely flexible,

624
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:32,140
不仅这样 他们定义了
and not only that, they define

625
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,060
一个无限复杂的数学问题
a mathematical problem of infinite complexity.

626
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,690
我会说
So I would say that,

627
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:39,900
"是的 组合是有限的 但某种程度上也是无限的"
"Yes, it is finite, but in a way it's also infinite."

628
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,070
我认为这是我们称作为
I think this is the beginning

629
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,820
系统创作力的开始
of what we call systematic creativity.

630
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:49,820
乐高这种把管子和螺柱组合在一起的基础系统
This basic system of tubes and studs that locks together,

631
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,970
乐高设计师

632
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:53,450
能展现一个孩子的或是一个成人的想法
and it will take a child's idea or an adult's idea,

633
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,950
还能把这些想法都聚在一起
and it'll hold it together.

634
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,670
让这些想法成形 给他们新的交流方式
It'll give it form and give them a new medium of communication.

635
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:01,960
关于乐高砖块的有趣的是 我们可以看到
The interesting thing with the LEGO brick, as we see here,

636
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:03,650
高级主管 乐高未来实验室

637
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,380
讲解砖块怎么互相搭配的说明书
is that the instructions for how it fits with the rest

638
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,880
实际上是潜移默化的
is actually embedded.

639
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,440
我们不需要说明书
We don't need an instruction.

640
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,380
我们不需要一本字典或是语法
We don't need a dictionary or grammar.

641
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:11,090
这是系统自带的
It's embedded in the system.

642
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,220
他变成了一个让
It became this platform

643
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,980
全世界的人共享一种语言的平台
where people all over the world had a shared language,

644
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:21,020
就像音乐中的谱子或音符
it's like the letters or notes in music.

645
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,730
乐高是一个创造性的工具
It's a creative tool,

646
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:25,150
它是一个创造媒介
it's a creative medium,

647
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:26,050
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h高级主管
乐高社区活动参与

648
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,950
但也是一种语言
but it's also a language.

649
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:30,240
但是一种比英语和Windows
It's a language that's more global

650
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,870
更全球化的语言
than English and Windows.

651
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:37,960
有这么一个无限制的产品
So with such a limitless product,

652
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,620
乐高公司是怎样
how did the LEGO company

653
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:42,330
不断获得成功的呢
experience anything but constant success?

654
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,570
信不信由你 不久之前
Believe it or not, not that long ago,

655
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:46,840
乐高陷入可怕的困境
the company was in pretty dire straits.

656
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,970
在CBS电视台的全球市场观望节目
On the CBS Worldwide Market Watch,

657
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:51,050
丹麦玩具制造商乐高
the Danish toymaker LEGO

658
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:52,870
CBS 晚间新闻 5月11,1999

659
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,100
今天报告它的首次年度亏损
today reported its first ever annual loss.

660
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,550
如果孩子喜欢 为什么
If the kids love it, why

661
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:58,180
丹麦总公司陷入这么多麻烦
then is the Danish company in so much trouble?

662
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,400
乐高所遭受的是公司在1978年
What happened to LEGO is LEGO had an unprecedented growth rate

663
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:04,590
首席执行官 乐高集团

664
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,150
获得玩具生产权以来都以史无前例的增长率增长
when it really got the bricks right in '78,

665
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,110
直到1990年中期
until the mid-1990s.

666
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,800
市场增长的很快 一切都很好
It was growing fast, everything was good,

667
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,450
突然就坍塌了
and it suddenly collapsed.

668
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:15,410
三大产品中的两个销售额跌落的很惨
Sales of two of their three big products fall off a cliff.

669
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:18,390
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h管理学教授
沃顿商学院

670
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:18,540
2003年几乎要破产
And they almost went out of business in 2003.

671
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:22,900
执行副总裁 乐高公司

672
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:22,830
10年前 我们的公司陷入严重的问题
Ten years ago, our company was in serious trouble,

673
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,840
而巧妙的的是 我们不能责怪任何人
and the wonderful thing about it, we couldn't blame anybody else.

674
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,630
他们失去了最重要的资产前景
They had lost sight of their most important asset:

675
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,130
那就是乐高系统的天才之处
the genius of the LEGO system.

676
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:35,350
来自世界各地的聪明的人在90年代告诉乐高
Smart people from around the world had told LEGO in the '90s

677
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:38,680
这些砖块会变得不那么好玩儿了
that this brick is gonna become irrelevant.

678
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,270
你需要另辟新径
You need to find new things.

679
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:43,480
这些看起来 实际上 已经不那么酷了
It was seen as-- Actually, this was seen as uncool.

680
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:47,110
乐高开始生产越来越多的定制特别套装
They were making more and more custom pieces for specific sets.

681
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:50,780
一方面来说 他们有超过14,000个独特部件
At one point, they had over 14, 000 unique elements.

682
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,310
而有些套装只有
Some of the sets had only a

683
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,950
很少的部件 且几乎并不需要动手组装
few elements and required almost no construction.

684
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:58,040
当我们制造易于构建的产品
When we made products which were quicker to build,

685
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,050
那些不喜欢建造的仍然说
those who didn't like to build still said,

686
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:01,250
"我不喜欢玩乐高
"I don't like to build it.

687
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:04,170
我宁愿买模型车或者玩偶什么的"
I'd rather buy a die-cast car or doll or something else."

688
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,790
真正喜欢乐高的人
And those who actually did like LEGO for what it is,

689
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,960
会说 "现在是怎样"
they said, "What is this now?"

690
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:11,010
因为我们不了解
And because we didn't understand that

691
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:13,680
坦白讲 我们其实
and also because we were actually, frankly,

692
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,550
作为一个公司面对我们的顾客相当自大
quite arrogant as a company towards our customers,

693
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,600
我们在生产错误的产品
we were making the wrong products,

694
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,850
我们甚至没法把产品递送到
and we were not even able to deliver the products

695
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,770
真正想在商店买的人手里
that people wanted to the stores.

696
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,520
乐高的粉丝知道错在哪里
Their fans knew what was wrong,

697
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,150
但是乐高高管没有
but LEGO company executives weren't paying attention

698
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:29,650
注意到玩家社区已经遍地都是了
to the community that had grown around their product.

699
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:32,190
改革的萌芽在几年前发布一款叫做Mindstorms
The seed of change had been planted a few years earlier

700
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:36,160
的机器人系列时就种下了
with the release of a product called Mindstorms.

701
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,620
这个小的黄色砖由乐高和麻省理工开发
This little yellow brick, developed by LEGO and MIT,

702
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:43,120
使乐高创造品变成可互动的机器人
turns LEGO creations into interactive robots.

703
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:46,500
对我们而言这是一次很棒的机会
For us this was a great opportunity,

704
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:47,770
学习研究教授 麻省理工

705
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:49,000
因为我们看到把乐高和计算机结合在一起的潜力
'cause we saw a great potential of combining LEGO and computers.

706
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:53,220
乐高有开发的打算
LEGO had in mind that they would develop it,

707
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:53,530
技术创新教授 麻省理工

708
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:57,090
然后孩子们可以按规定的方式玩机器人
and then kids would play with it in the prescribed way,

709
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,060
他们有孩子作为受众
and they had as an audience children,

710
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,350
即乐高标准的 传统的受众
their standard, traditional audience.

711
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,660
但是它是有点
But it really sort of

712
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,400
捕获到各个年龄的想象力
captured the imagination of people of all ages,

713
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,750
而不是像最初
not just the young people

714
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,940
只为年轻人设计的那样
that Mindstorms was initially intended for.

715
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,730
事实上 机器人系列推出的第一年
In fact, in the first year that Mindstorms came out,

716
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,280
一半的销售额是卖给成年人的
half of the sales were to adults for adult use.

717
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,900
有一个在斯坦福的人
Then there was someone who

718
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,490
喜欢乐高 他说
liked LEGO who was at Stanford and was like,

719
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,240
"嗯 这个砖块
"Hmm, this brick, I could

720
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,910
我可以黑了它然后写一个逆向程序"
hack that open and reverse engineer it."

721
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,960
他们拿机器人系列开刀
And they were opening up the Mindstorms.

722
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,830
他们为这个系列写新的软件
They were writing new software for it.

723
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,960
三个月内 一千个黑客在研究这个
Within three months, a thousand hackers were working on it.

724
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:34,800
对乐高而言很震惊
And this was rather a shock for them.

725
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,430
他们的回应是 "这是什么"
LEGO's response was pretty much like, "What is this?"

726
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,550
他们在拆开我们建造的成果
They're taking apart what we created.

727
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,220
我是说 我们把这些结合在一起 所以不能被分开
I mean, we put this together, so it shouldn't be taken apart.

728
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,730
那是我们的秘密
That's our secrets.

729
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:47,600
我们的管理层有很多问题
There was a lot of questions in our leadership.

730
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:49,760
我们可以要么
We could either take the

731
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,900
激进的 防御的控制路线
aggressive and protective and controlling route,

732
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,450
要么其他的路线说
and the other route would be to say well,

733
00:33:56,530 --> 00:34:00,280
这个有意思
this is, uh, interesting.

734
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:02,830
大多数公司里 传统的创新方式是
In most companies, and also in a very traditional way

735
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,040
对创新严格机密
of innovating was to have it super-secret.

736
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,470
就好比标着X的封闭墙壁
It's like closed walls, sign on the "X,"

737
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,170
我们什么都不能说
And we couldn't say anything.

738
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,420
我们和律师有很多内部讨论
We had a lot of internal discussions with our lawyers,

739
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,130
高级主管也有涉及
top management was involved.

740
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:15,760
凯尔不得不站起来说 "但是我想要这个
Kjeld had to stand up and say, "But I want this.

741
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,340
我们公司生产的产品 是人们可以拿来创造东西的
We're a company who makes things that people can create with."

742
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:25,140
当一个公司开始和用户打交道
When a company starts to deal with users,

743
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,980
然后发现可以在用户身上找到灵感
and discovers that it can get ideas from users,

744
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,480
这就是乐高智力风暴机器人系列
that's Mindstorms.

745
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,150
这是用一种新的方式来说
That's the new way of saying,

746
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:34,360
你需要和你的乐高成人粉打交道
you will deal with your Adult Fans Of LEGO,

747
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,650
你会从他们身上获得有益的想法
and you will get from them useful ideas.

748
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:39,320
我们需要意识到
We need to be aware

749
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:43,370
世界上最聪明的人中有99.99%
that 99.99%

750
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:46,620
都不为我们工作
of the smartest people in the world don't work for us.

751
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,840
在头脑风暴系列产品发布后
In the wake of the Mindstorms product release,

752
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,210
乐高公司开始以更开放的态度
the LEGO company was more open to ideas

753
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,300
吸纳设计室以外的灵感和想法
that came from outside the walls of its design room.

754
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,340
芝加哥建筑师亚当里德
Adam Reed TuckerChicago Architect Adam Reed

755
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:06,600
用乐高积木建造了摩天大楼
Tucker builds skyscrapers out of LEGO bricks

756
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:11,690
在2005年他的公司在金融危机下倒闭
In 2005, when his firm went belly-up from the economy,

757
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:14,310
亚当决定通过建造建筑模型
Adam decided to return to the more artistic side

758
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,280
重返更加有艺术美感的领域
of architecture by creating architectural models.

759
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:23,870
有一天 当我走出家门 走进了一家当地玩具店
One day I ventured out to a local toy store

760
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:27,490
店里摆满了装着乐高积木套装的购物车
and filled about a dozen shopping carts of LEGO sets

761
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,200
我想以这种方式重新熟悉砖瓦
to get reacquainted with the brick.

762
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:32,830
当我回到家后 我把这些积木倒了出来
And when I got home, I dumped out all these sets,

763
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,340
这时候我的未婚妻来了
and my fiancée came home,

764
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,340
她看到我坐在那儿
and she saw me sitting there

765
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,760
她便扭头走了
and she made a U-turn.

766
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,800
一小时后 她打电话给我问道
Then an hour later, called me and said,

767
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,630
有什么事儿是我需要知道的吗
"Is there something I need to know?"

768
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,260
亚当的作品很快吸引了
Adam's work soon caught the

769
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:47,060
乐高公司的帕普·史密斯-迈耶的注意力
attention of the LEGO company's Paal Smith-Meyer.

770
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,600
我产生了一个想法 与那些对我们所做事情
And I had this idea that let's start new business with people

771
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,270
抱有极大热情的人开展一项新的业务
who have a passionate feeling about what we do.

772
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:55,650
于是我去见了亚当
And then I meet Adam and he's standing there

773
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:59,150
他与自己用乐高积木组建的超高建筑物站在一起
with these super tall structures built out of LEGO.

774
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,570
然后我就 哇塞他们太棒了
And I'm like, "Wow! These are amazing.

775
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:04,950
我们可以做一整套产品线 但是我作为乐高的内部员工
We can do a whole line but me coming from the inside,

776
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,990
我需要证据 我需要实实在在的物证
I need evidence, you know, I need proof.

777
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,290
所以我们能向世界证明这个想法行得通
So we can prove to the world that this works.

778
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:12,330
两个月以后 我来到积木世界
Two months later, I come to BrickWorld and Adam says,

779
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,540
亚当说我有个惊喜给你
"I have a surprise for you."

780
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:17,710
亚当创造了第一套产品200盒
And then he's created 200 boxes of the first set.

781
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,880
亚当自己设计了盒子图样
On his own, Adam had designed the box graphics

782
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,380
并打包了每一套积木
and had packaged every single set.

783
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:28,180
如果亚当和帕普能成功制作建筑系列产品
If Adam and Paal could make the architecture series happen,

784
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,760
那结果也是可以令人信服的
it would take some convincing.

785
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:32,310
毕竟亚当向乐高玩具公司的提议
After all, what Adam was proposing to a toy company

786
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,890
实际上并不仅仅是一个玩具
wasn't exactly a toy,

787
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:38,360
迄今为止所有的乐高设计都出自乐高专用设计师之手
and up until now LEGO designs were only made by LEGO designers.

788
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:43,110
如果他当时没有坚持并且努力推动这个项目
If he hadn't taken and been so pushy,

789
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,070
今天的乐高建筑恐怕不会存在
architecture as it is today probably wouldn't happen.

790
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,990
这个系列是一个巨大的成功
The series was a success,

791
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,160
从那时起这个产品线也一直在不断扩张
and the line has been expanding ever since.

792
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:57,170
所以 这证明了我们可以和设计室以外的独立个人进行合作
So, it proved that we can work with individuals on the outside.

793
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,590
这个举动不会打垮乐高
It's not going to break LEGO.

794
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:00,630
事实上他们创造能量
It's actually creating energy.

795
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,850
他们创造希望
It's creating kind of this hope,

796
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:05,050
让我们去做更多的事情
uh, that we can make more things.

797
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,560
亚当现在正在开展新的工作 不断突破乐高的界线
Adam is now working on a new venture to push the LEGO boundaries.

798
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,150
在我做乐高建筑产品之后
Following up on what I did with the LEGO architecture,

799
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:21,230
我希望能为乐高创造一组过山车玩具
I wanted to create a roller coaster for LEGO.

800
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,570
我总是在想要推进产品线
I'm always about pushing the lines.

801
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,330
为了使过山车运作
To make the roller coaster work,

802
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:33,660
亚当在他的工作室里设计了两个新的元素
Adam designed two new elements in his workshop:

803
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,660
一个连接着铁轨的球状体
a ball joint attached to a rail tie,

804
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,210
还有一个套住球的环
and a hitch to mount the ball in.

805
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:40,840
他们创造了新的元素这件事
The fact that they do create new elements,

806
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,860
给了我一些希望
um, gives me hope that, you know,

807
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,920
这些元素也都是可以被创造的
these elements can also be created.

808
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:52,890
十天后 亚当在积木世界向帕普
Ten days later, Adam unveils his coaster prototype

809
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,470
展示了他的过山车雏形
for Paal at BrickWorld.

810
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,310
他非常的细致 非常棒
It's so smooth. It's amazing. Whee!

811
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,440
所以这就更像科幻小说里的那样
So, that's more of like um, a sci-fi kind of use.

812
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:05,400
这块像是一个赚到失控的煤矿
This one is a runaway coal mine.

813
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:07,070
是的 或者是银矿 是的
- Yeah. - Or silver mine. Yeah.

814
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:09,610
这在以前是不可能的
This would not have been possible before.

815
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:12,370
这看起来可能是一个过山车的零部件
It might look like a roller coaster part,

816
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,950
但是 你可以用它做你想做的任何东西
but hey, you can use it for anything you want.

817
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,250
我觉得这很棒
I think it's amazing.

818
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,870
我是说 我真的是这么想的
I mean, I definitely think that, you know,

819
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,130
世界各地的孩子们和成年人都会想要玩这个的
kids, adults all over the world will want to play with this.

820
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,790
每一个人  谢谢兄弟
- Everyone. - Thanks, buddy.

821
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,130
东京 日本

822
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:29,630
在东京 日本 康平西山
In Tokyo, Japan, Kohei Nishiyama

823
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:33,310
帮助打开了乐高社区的创意之门
has helped open the doors to creativity from the LEGO community.

824
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:36,430
他是一个做人群创意的专家 他管他的项目叫Cuusoo
He's an expert in crowd creation and calls his project Cuusoo,

825
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,730
也就是梦想或者愿望的意思
which means "Dream" Or "Wish."

826
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:42,560
康平和帕普合作创建了一个平台
Kohei worked with Paal to create a platform

827
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:45,570
能使乐高玩家的梦想成真
that brings LEGO users' dreams to reality.

828
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:48,820
乐高Cuusoo的创意在于让世界上的任何一个
The idea for LEGO Cuusoo is that anyone in the world

829
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,940
拥有乐高创意的人都能许愿让乐高有一天
who has a LEGO idea can "Wish"

830
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,620
把你的创意变成实实在在的玩具
That LEGO will one day make this.

831
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,040
你唯一需要做的事情就是在Cuusoo平台上
The only thing you have to do is actually share it

832
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,290
把你的创意分享出来
with the world on the Cuusoo platform,

833
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:59,470
并且通过这个平台
and through that,

834
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:02,580
创造一个围绕你愿望展开的有趣社区
create a community of interest around your wish.

835
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:06,130
那些得到10000个或更多乐高玩家支持的设计
Designs that gain support from 10,000 or more LEGO users

836
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,720
将被上报给乐高管理层
go up for review with LEGO management.

837
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,280
对于个人设计被乐高官方做成真实的玩具来说
It's quite an honor for a

838
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,050
这真是莫大的荣耀
design to get released as an official LEGO set.

839
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,810
第一个得到10000张选票的是乐高我的微观世界系列
The first idea that got 10,000 votes was LEGO Minecraft.

840
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:18,390
这只花了48小时
Took 48 hours.

841
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,140
这甚至让我们的服务器几度瘫痪
It broke our servers several times.

842
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,810
我想对于乐高粉来说
I think it's safe to say that LEGO fans

843
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,570
等待一个像康平的创意产生是一件肯定的事
were waiting for an idea like Kohei's to come along.

844
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:27,940
现在入围Cuusoo第五号套装
Now the finalists are being reviewed

845
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:30,150
的最终候选人都在被复审
for Cuusoo set number five.

846
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:35,640
华盛顿特区

847
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,800
如果这就是极客做的事儿的话
If this is what it is to be a geek,

848
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,450
我是百分百没意见的
I am definitely okay with that

849
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:42,580
因为 这是我经历过最有趣的事儿
'cause, uh, it's the most fun I've ever had.

850
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:47,460
Cuusoo不严格地翻译可以是指 愿望
"Cuusoo" Loosely translated means a wish.

851
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:52,340
我的愿望是看到更多的空间探索
And uh, my wish is to see more space exploration.

852
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:55,470
我希望人们能对宇宙空间探索更感兴趣
I want people to be more interested in space exploration.

853
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:59,640
我甚至从小学那会就知道
I knew even from elementary school

854
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,810
我长大了想成为一名机械工程师
that I wanted to be a mechanical engineer when I grew up.

855
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,480
问题是 中学里并没有
The trouble is, there were no

856
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,860
机械工程师的课程
mechanical engineering classes in middle school.

857
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:10,740
所以我想用乐高设计
So uh, I would design entire manned missions

858
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:13,410
一整套飞往木星执行载人飞行任务的机器
to Jupiter using LEGO designs.

859
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:17,370
大学毕业后 斯蒂芬找到了他的第一份工程师工作
After college, Stephen landed his first engineering job,

860
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:19,870
为NASA制作航天器
working on a space vehicle for NASA,

861
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,580
研制好奇号火星车
the Mars Curiosity Rover.

862
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,920
我在无尘间里度过了大量的时间
I spent a lot of time in clean rooms

863
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,420
围绕真正的漫游者零件开展工作
working around parts of the actual rover itself.

864
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,340
这是我最想做的事
It was all I could ever want to do.

865
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:34,800
这是一个巨大的 7英尺高 2000磅的
It's a huge, seven-foot-tall, 2,000-pound,

866
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,890
核动力 岩石钻探
nuclear-powered, rock-drilling,

867
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:39,720
激光爆破 科学操作的机器人
laser-blasting, science-performing robot.

868
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,350
最初我只想建造一个漫游者
Originally I just wanted to build a rover so I could,

869
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,900
这样我就可以向我的朋友和家人展示我到底在做什么样的工作
you know, show my friends and family what I was working on

870
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:52,740
还有这项工作有多酷 别人都不知道
and how cool it was before anyone else even knew about it.

871
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:57,620
这个是偏离差速器摇臂转向架悬挂系统
This is the off-set differential , rocker bogey suspension system.

872
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:01,370
在顶端这里是 偏离差速器手臂
And on top here is the uh, off-set differential arm

873
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:03,200
在漫游者顶端摆动
that swings across the top of the rover,

874
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:07,170
他连接悬挂系统的左边和右边
and it connects the left and right sides of the suspension system

875
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:10,250
这样的设计使得漫游者在不平的地表
that allows the rover to keep all six wheels on the ground

876
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,840
也能六个轮子都着地行走
as it travels over uneven terrain.

877
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,590
这并不是要与火星人打仗或者什么的
It doesn't have to be, you know, battling Martians or anything.

878
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,680
做这些都是为了科学
It's doing it all for science.

879
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,810
我不是一个很外向的人
I'm not a very outgoing person,

880
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:23,890
我以前不是经常
and I didn't always, uh,

881
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,190
和很多乐高玩家互动
interact with a lot of LEGO users before.

882
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:28,230
我有我自己的私人收藏
I just had my own personal collection.

883
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:30,230
但是我喜欢那种你如何剪断自己脐带
And I like how you can disconnect the umbilical

884
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,400
从自己封闭的世界走出来的感觉
and take the capsule off...

885
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,320
我参加了我的第一场乐高玩家大会
I went to my very first uh, LEGO Users Group meeting,

886
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,820
叫做 LUG
called uh, a LUG.

887
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:39,030
好奇号火星车收到了很多好评
And uh, the Curiosity Rover was received very well.

888
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,280
每个人都觉得他棒极了
Everyone thought it was awesome.

889
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:44,080
事实上他们都说 嘿 你应该把这个作品上传到Cuusoo上
In fact they said, "Hey, you should submit this model to Cuusoo."

890
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,580
当然啦 我心里的孩童想
And of course, the kid in me thought,

891
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,880
哇我也可以做一名乐高设计师 这简直太棒
"Oh, wow, I could be a LEGO designer. "That's awesome."

892
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,540
看着这个作品我给他投了票
Looking at it and I voted for it,

893
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,340
最开始的话只有 好像几百张票吧
and there was only, like, a few hundred votes.

894
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,920
之后一周内我又去看了一下
Then within a week I looked at it again.

895
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:55,630
事情一下子变得不一样了
It started going up all of a sudden, I went,

896
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,970
等下 这是斯蒂芬的作品 简直太酷了
"Wait a minute, that's Stephen's. This is cool!"

897
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:01,600
我对其他参赛者的作品有一点了解
I know a little bit about the other contestants,

898
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,600
其中一个绝对是
and one of them would definitely be

899
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,640
乐高公司制作的最大的乐高套装
the largest LEGO set that LEGO has ever produced

900
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:09,100
如果他们确实把他变成了一个积木套装的话
if they actually did turn it into a set.

901
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:18,640
瑞士

902
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,780
这花费了我大约9个月去完成
Took me about nine months to complete it.

903
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:23,700
当然 这不仅仅是一个建筑 这是一项研究
It's not just building, of course. It's research.

904
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:27,870
我得找齐所有的模型图片和所有零部件
I had to find all the pictures for the model and all the parts.

905
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,750
不到最后我根本无法确定他能否被完成
I wasn't sure until the end if it's going to work

906
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,300
还有驾驶时的重量问题 但是很幸运我都做到了
and drive because of the weight, but I was lucky with that.

907
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,430
这并不仅仅是威信的问题
It's not just about prestige.

908
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:41,570
如果最终的设计被选中了
If the finalists' designs are chosen,

909
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:43,350
他们会从销售纯利中得到1%的分红
they'll get 1% of the net sales.

910
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:47,100
如果我赢了 我会把他建造成比原来大一倍的样子
If I win, then I will build it twice this size

911
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,730
并且在沙漠中驾驶它
and ride on it through the desert.

912
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,300
奥克兰 新西兰

913
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,990
之后他会一直不停的继续开
It will just keep going round and round.

914
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,500
今年Cuusoo项目的第三个决赛选手
The third finalist in this year's Cuusoo project

915
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:10,080
是一个新西兰的尼克 沃什领导的乐高玩家俱乐部
is a user group led by New Zealander Nick Vás.

916
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:14,250
尼克和他的团队用乐高积木
Nick and his team have created LEGO models

917
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,000
创造了电子游戏 传送门2
of the video game Portal 2,

918
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:18,510
这个游戏非常受乐高玩家的喜爱
which is very popular with the LEGO crowd.

919
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:22,180
我们决定让传送门成为我们Cuusoo项目的主题
We had decided on Portal as the topic for our Cuusoo project,

920
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,760
就是因为我们都对乐高和portoal
simply because we had a common love for LEGO

921
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:26,310
这款电子游戏都同样有爱
and Portal as a video game.

922
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:28,810
传送门项目是其中最快达到
The Portal Project was one of the fastest ever to reach

923
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:30,810
被考虑为Cuusoo网站上入围决赛的
the necessary 10,000 votes to be considered

924
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:33,520
必要条件 10000票这个要求的设计
a finalist on the Cuusoo website.

925
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:36,400
我们认为我们的项目是最能脱颖而出的
We think that our project is the most likely.

926
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,990
我们对胜出抱有很大的希望
We're holding high hopes that it will be us.

927
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:40,890
我为他们投了票 因为我玩这个游戏
I voted for them, 'cause I played the game,

928
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:41,900
而且我也乐在其中
and I really enjoyed it.

929
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:45,740
同样 我也希望那一个也能被选中
And I was... I'm hoping that one could be chosen, too.

930
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:48,910
我一定会买很多套这款积木的
I would definitely buy multiple copies of that set.

931
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,200
所以如果这项产品投入生产了
So if the product goes to design,

932
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:51,910
你打算用得到的钱做什么
what are you going to do with all the money?

933
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,830
如果我能想做什么就做什么的话
If I could do whatever I wanted with it,

934
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,750
我想我肯定还会去买乐高的
I think it would probably all go right back to LEGO.

935
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,420
所以基本上来讲你是为了积木去做这件事的
So basically you're doing it for the brick.

936
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:00,920
是的 很对
Yeah, pretty much.

937
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,760
我认为Cuusoo最有趣
I think the interesting thing,

938
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:07,850
也许也是最可怕的事情
and then maybe the scary thing with Cuusoo,

939
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:10,680
就是他真正的开放了公司
is that it has actually opened the company,

940
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:13,390
他真的几乎完全把公司内外颠倒了
it has actually almost turned it inside out.

941
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,020
之前的运营模式 你知道
What happened before with, you know, this,

942
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:19,400
所有的设计都是秘密 都在封闭的院墙之内
everything happened in secret, behind closed walls,

943
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,400
而现在一切颠倒了
is now reversed.

944
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:25,570
他现在给全世界创造了一件激动人心的事
It's created an excitement in the world that we can,

945
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:29,580
就是我们可以一起塑造乐高产品的未来
together, shape the future of LEGO products.

946
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:33,250
几个月的考察后 乐高代表将会揭露
After months of review, LEGO representatives are ready to reveal

947
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:35,460
这三个最终入围决赛的设计
which of the three finalists

948
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,500
到底哪一个会被选为Cuusoo套装005号
will be chosen as Cuusoo set number 005.

949
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:46,010
你们大家激动吗
Are you guys excited?

950
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,270
这将是你们见到的下一个Cuusoo模型
This is the next Cuusoo model that you're gonna see.

951
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:54,600
冠军是
The winner...

952
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:56,230
好奇号火星车
the Mars Curiosity Rover.

953
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,150
无论我幻想了多少次这个场景
No matter how much I fantasized about it,

954
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,070
还是无法和我听到梦想实现的时候相比
it couldn't prepare me for the reality of the actual news.

955
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,240
我百感交集
I have all sorts of emotions and feelings running through me.

956
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:14,290
很难尝试着去形容这些感觉
It's hard to try and describe how they all feel

957
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:17,170
当这些感觉混合起来的时候
when they're mushed together like that.

958
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,630
乐高社区的创意
Innovation from the LEGO community

959
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:24,840
并不是一定需要乐高公司的参与
doesn't necessarily need to have the LEGO company's involvement.

960
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,930
当乐高公司对外界的创新者
While the LEGO company is more and more open

961
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:28,510
越来越开放
to innovators from the outside,

962
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,890
还有一些人希望能为自己定制一套乐高
there are others who are customizing on their own.

963
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:32,880
在西雅图 华盛顿
In Seattle, Washington,

964
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,020
威尔·查普曼围绕着乐高产品的生产线
Will Chapman has built a successful business

965
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,810
的一个漏洞经营着一份成功的生意
around a hole in the LEGO product line.

966
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,940
这是一款M2勃朗宁机枪
This is an M2 machine gun.

967
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:43,150
这是一款二战时期MP40德国机关枪
This is the MP40 German machine gun from World War II.

968
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,280
我自己的大口径狙击步枪
My HCSR.

969
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,700
他的生意是制作人仔规模的枪
His business manufactures minifigure-scaled guns.

970
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:49,370
他为什么会从事这个呢
Now, why would he do that?

971
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,160
乐高不会做我做的东西
LEGO will not produce what I produce.

972
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,310
老板 玩具制造公司

973
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,250
乐高不会做任何当代武器
LEGO won't do any weapons that are modern.

974
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:57,330
他们会做荒野西部 这大约是19世纪中期的事了
They'll do Wild West, which is maybe up to the mid-1800s.

975
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:59,960
之后我们做了一些后现代主义的东西 星球大战
And then we got postmodern, which is Star Wars.

976
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:05,130
武器不符合乐高"开心地玩"的哲学
Weapons don't fit into the LEGO "Play well" Philosophy.

977
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:08,220
我认为作为一家丹麦公司 枪支拥有权这个主意
I think being a Danish company, the idea of handgun ownership,

978
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,890
武器拥有并不是他们文化的一部分
weapon ownership is not a big part of their culture.

979
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:12,890
所以我说 不如我们自己来试试吧
So I said, "Let's try it ourselves."

980
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:14,290
当我设计了一个武器的时候
When I design a weapon,

981
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:16,810
我去网上找了一些能激发我灵感的照片
I look online for some inspirational photos.

982
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:20,020
人仔的问题是 他们的手太大了
The trouble with the minifigure is they have giant-- giant hands,

983
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,610
他们只是人类的缩小版
and they're a squashed-down representation of a human.

984
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:25,230
设计他们实在是太难了
They're really tough to try to design for.

985
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,530
这是艺术
It's art.

986
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:29,280
真的 我 相信这是艺术
It's truly, I believe it's art.

987
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:37,870
他们买来给军队装备的人
The folks that are buying to equip an army

988
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,080
总是成年人 然后他们会买几百把枪
are always adults, and they'll buy a hundred of one gun,

989
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:41,790
买200个头盔
they'll buy 200 of a helmet.

990
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,710
从一些只是全副武装的小人偶
It's gone from just a couple of figures armed with a weapon,

991
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,760
到组成场景 完整的战役 诺曼底登陆 诺曼底入侵
to scenes, entire battles, D-Day landing, Normandy Invasion.

992
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,050
也有费卢杰进攻
There's invasions of Fallujah,

993
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,350
也有现代海军 现代军队
there's modern military Marines, there's modern army.

994
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:55,470
你需要一把 这可是标志性武器M16
You need an M16. It's an iconic weapon.

995
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,810
这开始于一个兴趣 我从没想过
This started as a hobby, and I never thought

996
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,430
这会变成
that this would turn into

997
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:06,320
一个世界现象
something that could be a worldwide phenomenon.

998
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,070
乐高的世界顺应潮流 非常模块化
The LEGO world is so adaptable, it's so modular,

999
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:12,030
乐高不需要去做决定
that LEGO doesn't get to decide.

1000
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,410
我们来决定我们想怎样运用这些元素
We get to decide how we want to build with those elements.

1001
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:19,960
咔
Cut!

1002
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,840
来吧伙计们 生动一点 你们太僵硬啦
Come on, guys, put some life into it. You're so stiff.

1003
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:28,010
好 那我们就休息五分钟吧
Okay, let's just take five then.

1004
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:29,470
外行
Amateurs.

1005
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:31,720
好吧 我在哪儿 哦好的
All right, where was I... Oh, right.

1006
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:32,840
旁白呢
Narrator guy!

1007
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:37,850
好 乐高系统证实了玩儿是个很重要的事情
Okay, the LEGO system has proven it's a great thing for play,

1008
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:40,600
但是他也能用在更严肃的事业上吗
but can it be used for more serious endeavors?

1009
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:43,600
世界上有一些人将乐高用作工具
There's people around the world using LEGO as a tool

1010
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:45,860
跟把他用作玩具一样 我们来看
as much as a toy. Cut to:

1011
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,760
博伊西 爱荷华州

1012
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:48,730
外部 远景 爱荷华州博伊西
Exterior. Establishing shot. Boise, Idaho.

1013
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:56,330
我们在我妈的车库 我们正在制作一部电影《熔点》
We're in my mom's garage, and we're making my film Melting Point.

1014
00:47:56,410 --> 00:47:59,830
这是一部用乐高积木搭建的单格拍摄动画电影
It's a stop-motion animated film made with LEGO bricks.

1015
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:04,700
乔纳森·沃恩和马特·科恩
Jonathan Vaughan and Matt

1016
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:06,210
在洛杉矶一个电影学校相识
Cohen met at film school in Los Angeles,

1017
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,300
他们都退学了 因为他们
but they both dropped out because they were frustrated

1018
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:10,590
可以做的项目都受挫失败了
by the scale of projects they could do.

1019
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:14,220
我以前觉得乐高积木就是给孩子玩的
I used to think that LEGOs were just for kids

1020
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,890
直到我遇到了乔纳森
until I met Jonathan

1021
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:19,600
并且从乐高电影社区得到了一个望远镜
and got a telescope into the LEGO brick filming community.

1022
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,730
和积木电影一起 你是无拘无束没有限制的
With brick films, you're uninhibited.

1023
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:24,980
如果他需要一个12英里的高速公路来开展一场射击汽车追逐
If he needs a 12-mile highway to shoot a car chase,

1024
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,810
他只需建造一个12英里的高速公路
he builds the 12-mile highway.

1025
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:29,570
无论他想到什么 他都可以建造出来 而且他做了
Whatever he thinks of, he builds it and he does it.

1026
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:32,110
让人能走路 比如走5英尺
To get somebody to walk, like, five feet,

1027
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,990
你需要15个框架来满足每一秒的步行场景
you have to take 15 frames every second of that walk.

1028
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:38,910
所以你不得不非常仔细的移动他们
So you have to move them in just little millimeter increments.

1029
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:40,370
这实在是太单调乏味了
It's incredibly tedious.

1030
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:43,210
我从来没有做过这么耗费时间的事情
There's nothing else I've ever done that takes this long.

1031
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:45,290
但是当你操作人仔的时候
But when you're working with minifigs,

1032
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:48,000
你不需要在乎代理人或者自尊或者任何事
you don't have to deal with agents or egos, or anything

1033
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:51,010
因为你在和非常有规范的演员合作
that befalls working with regular actors.

1034
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:52,720
他们很棒
They're great.

1035
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,260
如果我想一天做16小时 他们也不会抱怨
If I want to do a 16-hour day, they don't complain.

1036
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,640
没有加班
No overtime.

1037
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:01,870
乔纳森妈妈

1038
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,810
乔纳森正为他的电影创造新的场景
Jonathan's creating one of his sets for his movie.

1039
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:04,100
他们在车库里进行这项工作
They're doing the work in the garage.

1040
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:07,730
他跟我说他正在制作一部电影 我必须对他有信心
He tells me he's making a movie. I have to take that on faith.

1041
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:10,020
他正在玩儿乐高的玩具
He's playing with LEGOs,

1042
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:12,820
这也是他从蹒跚学步的孩童时期就开始做的事
something that he's done since he was a toddler.

1043
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:17,370
我的家人也很支持我
My family has been pretty supportive about this.

1044
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:18,700
他非常有创造力
He's very creative,

1045
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:19,910
但是我也非常想
but I would really like

1046
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:22,120
我的车能重新停回车库
to be able to park my car in the garage, yes.

1047
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:29,590
积木电影有很长的历史传统
Well, there's been a long tradition of brick films.

1048
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:32,590
我最喜欢的积木电影制作人之一是大卫·帕加诺
One of my favorite brick film makers is David Pagano.

1049
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:35,420
纽约的电影制作人大卫·帕加诺
New York filmmaker David Pagano

1050
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:37,890
从他九岁起就开始制作积木电影
has been making brick films since he was nine.

1051
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:40,600
大卫被认为是乐高顶级的动画片绘制者
David is considered one of the top LEGO animators,

1052
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:44,100
而且因为用积木创造了复杂的角色而闻名
and is known for creating complex characters out of bricks.

1053
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:45,610
你看的大多数电影
Most films you're going to

1054
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:48,020
都会把人仔当成主要的演员
see will have minifigures as the main actor.

1055
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:48,080
乐高电影制作者

1056
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,110
因为他们足够灵活
They're just articulated enough to be

1057
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:52,190
可以被做出各种有趣的造型
moveable into a variety of fun poses,

1058
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:55,070
但是还没有灵活到你不用
but not so over-articulated that you need help

1059
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:57,280
摆弄他们就可以恰当的站直的地步
getting them to stand up properly,

1060
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,070
或者看起来像一个普通的人类
or look like a normal human being,

1061
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,120
或者跟没有鼻子的人一样正常
or as normal as someone with no nose looks.

1062
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,580
嘿
Hey!

1063
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:04,620
我用人仔做了很多东西
I have done a lot of stuff with minifigures,

1064
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,080
不仅为乐高也为我自己
both for LEGO and just for myself,

1065
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,750
但是我就是没法
but I also am just endlessly

1066
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:10,420
从用积木建造各种玩意儿的巨大吸引力中走出来
fascinated with what you can build from bricks.

1067
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,000
我觉得比起现成的演员
I just find it an interesting challenge

1068
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:14,710
用乐高玩具更有趣和挑战性
as opposed to having a readymade actor.

1069
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,220
我宁愿找办法去做一个整洁的角色
I'd rather figure out ways to make neat-looking characters,

1070
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,220
然后确保他们都能用动画的方式呈现
and then make sure they're animate-able,

1071
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:21,640
之后再给他们生命
then bring them to life.

1072
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:26,770
我有点像一个乐高的档案管理员
I am somewhat of a LEGO archivist.

1073
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:28,770
开心的时候我觉得我是
On my better days I consider myself

1074
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:31,650
乐高动画的历史学家 如果这样的工作存在的话
a LEGO animation historian, if such a job exists.

1075
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:33,730
我并不认为他存在但是我会一直对自己假装
I don't think it does, but I'll pretend to myself,

1076
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:35,780
直到别人叫我停止
until someone tells me to stop.

1077
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:38,610
所以最初的乐高电影是宣传视频
So, the very first LEGO films were promotional videos

1078
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:41,070
或者六七十年代制作的商业片
or commercials that were made in the '60s and '70s.

1079
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:44,160
我认为中间一大部分
I think it should have a big middle part

1080
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,410
和两边的电影脱颖而出了
and two little sides that stick out.

1081
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,330
但是第一部粉丝电影直到
But the first fan film didn't come

1082
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,290
20世纪80年代才面世
until the mid-to-late 1980s,

1083
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,210
这个电影叫《魔法传送门》
and that was a film called The Magic Portal.

1084
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:58,340
他们用很有趣的方式摆放斜块积木
They used sloped pieces in a really interesting way

1085
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,470
你可以得到这些在积木套装上爬行
where you could get these weird little blobby creatures

1086
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:02,050
的奇奇怪怪的斑点小生物
that crawl along the set.

1087
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:03,800
这儿也有一些用老的乐高挖土机碎片
There's some nice animation

1088
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:05,600
做的不错的动画片
with some of the old LEGO backhoe pieces.

1089
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:10,020
在2000年 乐高公司真的开始起飞
In the early 2000s, LEGO films really started to take off.

1090
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,190
每个人都有网络 而且这个看起来
Everyone had the Internet, and it was starting to become

1091
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:15,270
并不会快速过时  这并不是一时的流行
this thing that was not going away, it wasn't a fad.

1092
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,460
而是在每个人的家里
And it was in everybody's

1093
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:18,360
这也作为一种连接人与人的方式
home as a way to connect with other people.

1094
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,320
这是一种 我会称作是
That's sort of when I would say

1095
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,410
乐高动画的摩登时代开启
"The modern era" Of LEGO animation started.

1096
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:32,170
你可以在网上找到
The LEGO animation content

1097
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:33,920
乐高动画的全部内容
that you can find online just runs the gamut.

1098
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,670
这事很酷 这事也很奇怪
There's cool stuff, there's weird stuff.

1099
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,590
有些东西放在一起真的很棒
There's some stuff that's really well put together

1100
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:41,510
而且拍摄的也非常棒
and just shot gorgeously

1101
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:44,050
而且每个部分的运用也非常有趣
and has really interesting parts usage.

1102
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:45,550
当然也有很不合适的东西
There's immensely inappropriate stuff.

1103
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,180
无论好坏你都可以得到
You can get all kinds.

1104
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:54,440
还有一件变得很常见的事情是
One thing that's become pretty common

1105
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,570
我们把有名的电影或者电影预告片的场景
is shot-for-shot remakes of scenes from famous films

1106
00:51:57,650 --> 00:51:59,110
一个一个镜头的重新制作
or film trailers.

1107
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:01,200
所以他们会为你看到的每一帧电影制作不同的积木套装
So they'll build each set that you see in each shot...

1108
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,660
描述一下玛瑟卢斯·华莱士是什么样的
Describe what Marsellus Wallace looks like!

1109
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:06,370
什么  你再说一遍
- What? - Say what again!

1110
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:07,660
我看过黑暗骑士
I've seen The Dark Knight.

1111
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:12,040
如果在各方面都做到了极致
If you devote yourself to an ideal,

1112
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:14,630
那就会升华到另一种境界
then you become something else entirely.

1113
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:17,380
艾德·希兰有一支被授权
Ed Sheeran has a music video that someone was commissioned

1114
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:19,260
乐高化的MV
to make into LEGO.

1115
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:22,720
我要把这些积木挨个捡起来
I'm going to pick up the pieces

1116
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,430
搭建一个乐高房子
And build a LEGO house

1117
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:26,760
除了这个 人们还可以用乐高
Another thing that people are recreating with LEGO

1118
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:29,060
重现盛事之景
is just, like, news events.

1119
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:31,810
一些人试图重演奥运会
Some people were re-creating Olympic scenes,

1120
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:33,810
从菲利克斯·保加拿(奥地利极限运动员)从空中起跳的那一刹那算起
and when Felix Baumgartner did that jump from space,

1121
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:37,980
二十四小时后 这个场景就得以通过积木的形式再现出来
there was, like, a LEGO version of it, like, 24 hours later.

1122
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:43,200
如果你在Youtube上搜索乐高
If you do a YouTube search for LEGO,

1123
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,780
你会发现这个词至少有一千三百万的点击率
you're going to find 13 million hits at least.

1124
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:57,130
我认为这种情况会变得更加普遍
I think it will only get more prevalent

1125
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:59,880
也会有更多的人去推动它
and there will only be more and more people doing it

1126
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,340
因为这实在是件有趣的事情
because it's super fun.

1127
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,680
我的天 我喜欢这首歌
Oh, my gosh! I love this song!

1128
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,680
这部乐高电影虽然是用电脑绘图制作的
The LEGO Movie was done with computer graphics,

1129
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,770
但看上去却像是用积木搭建出来的
but made to look like a brick film.

1130
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:13,390
导演特别点明
The director specifically said

1131
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:16,350
他们是受到了乐高定格视频的启发
they were inspired by LEGO stop-motion web videos.

1132
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,190
可以直接将素材转而用之 这真是再好不过了
And it's cool that they were able to include a few of those.

1133
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:20,690
在这部电影的高潮部分
In the climax of The LEGO Movie,

1134
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,780
你就可以看到我拍的清洁工那部分了
you can see my film Garbage Man.

1135
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:23,900
哇 好赞
Whoa! Awesome!

1136
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:25,120
它不是严格意义上的积木电影
It's technically not a

1137
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,320
因为它毕竟还是电脑制作出来的
brick film because it's computer generated.

1138
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:29,990
但我们的电影会全部按照积木电脑的流程来走
Ours is going to be fully stop motion,

1139
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:33,500
所以我严密把关 就是为了确定这是个
so I'm trying to make one that's the best quality

1140
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:35,580
有持久性的好模子
for a really long running time.

1141
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,710
这将是乐高电影历史上的举世无双之作
It will be the greatest LEGO movie ever made.

1142
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:38,920
如果不是 那我就失败了
Otherwise, I've failed.

1143
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,380
在这部电影里 有一名警察
In the film, there's this cop,

1144
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:43,380
一个一心只想当警察
who all he ever wanted to do was be a cop,

1145
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:44,800
他叫托尼
this little LEGO guy named Tony.

1146
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,840
他之前是个玩滑板的
And he used to be a skateboarder,

1147
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:48,760
所以他可以踩着滑板追犯人
so he can chase criminals down on his skateboard.

1148
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:52,970
然后这个人叫杜曼 超级无敌大反派
And then this guy Duman, this great classic super villain,

1149
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:55,810
来到这座城市 纵火烧毁一切
comes into town and just starts burning everything down.

1150
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:58,440
现在 为这无限的融化…
Right now, you're afraid...

1151
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,190
而颤抖吧
of melting.

1152
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:02,440
不出几秒 焦灼感就会吞噬
In a few seconds, you'll feel the burn

1153
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:05,360
你那塑料做的小眼球
in your little, plastic eyeballs.

1154
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:07,400
你是想要这种效果吗
Was that the direction you want to go?

1155
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:10,240
嗯 我正在探索中 哇
- Yeah. I'm digging that. - Wow.

1156
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:12,160
我一开始制作这部电影的时候
When I was originally working on the film,

1157
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,580
并没有准备筹款
I wasn't planning to raise any money.

1158
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:15,960
但是马特看过剧本之后
But then Matt looked at the script.

1159
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,540
我就问 你接下来准备做什么
I was like, how are you going to do this?

1160
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:19,420
你积木够吗
Do you have enough bricks?

1161
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:22,340
这可比你之前做的任何一个决定都重大
This is way bigger than anything you've done that I've seen.

1162
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:24,210
他说 "嗯
And he said, "Uh, well,

1163
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,920
我们可能要用一些电脑图像界面来填补城市里的空白
we'll have to fill in the city probably with some CGI,

1164
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:28,340
不过也可能需要多一点的积木"
maybe get a little bit more bricks."

1165
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:30,180
然后我说 "不行
And I was like, "No.

1166
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:32,180
你得用真材实料地建一个城市出来
You have to build a city.

1167
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:35,640
这部电影必须是乐高史上的传世之作 乔纳森"
This has to be the greatest LEGO movie ever made, Jonathan."

1168
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:38,440
所以我就回答他 “好吧 我们得把开头拍得牛一点"
And so I said, "Okay, we have to do a Kickstarter."

1169
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,560
你好 我是乔纳森·沃恩 我正在导演《熔点》
Hi, I'm Jonathan Vaughan, and I'm directing Melting Point,

1170
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:44,480
这是一部用乐高积木搭出来的分帧电影
which is a stop-motion animated film made with LEGO bricks.

1171
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:46,690
我是罗伯特·弗利特饰演杜曼
I'm Robert Fleet. I'm playing Duman.

1172
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:49,910
我要烧掉好多东西 特别好玩
I get to melt things a lot. It's really fun.

1173
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:50,820
开始
Action.

1174
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:52,070
大家听一下
So, guys, here's what I

1175
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:54,200
这是我对现在拍好的镜头的一些想法
was thinking up for the establishing shot.

1176
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:57,200
我们需要把这里的所有东西都建好
We're going to need to build basically everything you see here,

1177
00:54:57,290 --> 00:54:59,330
所以基本上来说 就是整个城市了
so pretty much the entire city.

1178
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:00,920
那就是说我们要用电脑图像了?
We're going to have to use CGI, then?

1179
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,840
不 不用
I will not use CGI, okay?

1180
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:06,670
我要这个成为传世之作
I want this to be the best brick film ever made.

1181
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:10,550
乐高是作为玩具被创造出来的 但现在 它就是…
LEGO started as a toy, but now it's definitely--

1182
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,260
就是人们在他们这个古怪的爱好的世界里宣泄自己情感的方式
it's a way people are expressing themselves in this weird hobby,

1183
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:15,560
所以它自然也是一种工具
so it's definitely also a tool

1184
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:19,270
注定了要为了完成更重大的使命 注定了要讲述不平凡的故事
and a means to an end, a means to tell stories

1185
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:23,730
也注定了要用更宏大的方式展现你自己
and express yourself in a gigantic variety of ways.

1186
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:27,190
放眼世界 人们不断地在试图
All around the world, people are pushing the limits

1187
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,070
在乐高这个世界里进行创新
of what they can do with the LEGO system,

1188
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:31,160
试图开发出更新的建造材料
and what it's capable of as a building material.

1189
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:35,410
现在我正式宣布 以一百一十二英尺
Now I can officially say, that with the height of 112 feet,

1190
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:38,120
十一又四分之三英寸高度来看
11 and three-quarters inches,

1191
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:41,920
你们现在已经成为吉尼斯世界纪录这个大家庭里的成员了
you are now members of the Guinness World Records family.

1192
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,540
我现在要授予你这张证书 祝贺你们
I'd like to present this certificate and congratulate all of you.

1193
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:47,210
-太棒了  -我们打破世界纪录了
- Yes! - We broke the record.

1194
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:49,530
弥尔顿

1195
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,890
在墨尔本史蒂夫·萨马蒂诺和劳尔·奥伊达
In Melbourne, Steve Sammartino and Raul Oaida

1196
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:56,720
用乐高积木几乎做出了一整辆车
built a working car almost entirely out of LEGO bricks.

1197
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:58,810
这辆车不会设定任何的速度记录
It's not going to set any land speed records,

1198
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:00,560
当然 就算设定了也跑不到
and it doesn't go all that far,

1199
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:04,270
但仅仅从能跑这方面来看 这辆积木车已经够厉害了
but just the mere fact that it does go is quite something.

1200
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,440
安德鲁·卡罗尔是苹果公司的工程师
Andrew Carol, an engineer at Apple,

1201
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,670
一直在研究一种古希腊的装置
studied the remnants of a

1202
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:09,860
这套装置被发现于爱琴海底
Greek device used to determine celestial events,

1203
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:12,490
是用来观测天文现象的
which was found at the bottom of the Aegean Sea.

1204
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:16,200
他将这套装置重新改造了一下 毋庸置疑 用的是乐高积木
Then he reconstructed it from, you guessed it, LEGO bricks.

1205
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:19,920
在乐高大会上 粉丝们齐聚一堂
At conventions, fans get

1206
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,040
建立球模组
together to build great ball contraptions,

1207
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:26,290
或者GBC GBC是用来在模块之间传递球的
or GBCs, which deliver balls from one module to another.

1208
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:28,960
GBC是一尊动态雕塑
The GBC is a collaborative effort

1209
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:31,510
它的形成是大家共同努力的结果
to make a kinetic sculpture, if you will.

1210
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:35,760
在这里 如果你仔细观察 一旦球被碰击 就有两下反转
In this case, if you watch, when this ball hits, two flip off.

1211
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:38,390
时间被精密地掌控好 所以这个门可以反转两次
And they're timed so that this gate double flips.

1212
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:42,520
就连在谷歌工作的劳瑞·佩奇都在和乐高积木打交道
Even Google's Larry Page used LEGO bricks.

1213
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:47,400
实话实说 在大学我就用乐高做了一台喷墨打印机出来
Actually, in college I built an inkjet printer out of LEGOs.

1214
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,020
佩奇和谢尔盖·布林甚至
Page and Sergey Brin even

1215
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:51,740
用乐高积木做出了他们的第一个服务器
built their first server out of LEGO bricks.

1216
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:54,570
在英国 电视主持人詹姆斯·梅
In England, TV host James May

1217
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:58,490
决定用积木建造他的工作室
decided to build an entire working house out of LEGO bricks.

1218
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:00,020
所以 乐高的这个系统
So, the LEGO system can

1219
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:02,660
可以让人们制作出有实用性的工具
enable people to make real, working stuff.

1220
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:06,830
有时候 制作工具的过程是十分消耗脑细胞的
Sometimes, however, the goal is more cerebral.

1221
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:10,650
纽约市

1222
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:16,140
你觉得这个怎么样
What do you think that is?

1223
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:17,510
是不是很棒
How great is that?

1224
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,430
你要用你手机拍张照片吗
You going to take a picture with your cell phone?

1225
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,980
老实说 我一开始没看到它 是我妹妹告诉我的
Well, I didn't see it at first. My sister pointed it out to me.

1226
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:30,480
我是一名学前班老师 对乐高特别着迷
And I'm a preschool teacher, and I am drawn to LEGOs.

1227
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:33,610
我是从印第安纳州来的 我们那里不常看到像乐高这样的东西
I'm from Indiana, we don't see things like that in Indiana.

1228
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,280
这对于我来说很新奇
So, it's unusual.

1229
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:57,220
人们是如此的熟悉乐高积木
People are so familiar with LEGO bricks.

1230
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:00,010
基本上所有人都知道如何将积木拼插在一起
Most everyone you know has snapped a few bricks together,

1231
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:03,930
所以 积木艺术是大众化的 和生活息息相关的
and so that makes the art accessible, it makes it relatable.

1232
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:11,940
我第一次去美术馆的时候就说了
When I first started going to galleries and saying,

1233
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,440
"嘿 我是搞乐高艺术的"
"Hey, I do LEGO art."

1234
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:15,490
他们就看了看我然后说
They kind of looked at me and said,

1235
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:18,220
艺术家

1236
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:17,610
"哦是吗 是和车和城堡打交道吗?"
"Oh, okay, is that cars and trucks or castles?"

1237
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:21,200
你懂的 他们对乐高艺术有种固定化的看法
You know, they have a set notion of what LEGO art would be.

1238
00:58:24,330 --> 00:58:26,910
我每个月都要订购上万块积木
I order tens of thousands of bricks every month.

1239
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,750
就是这么疯狂 我就是这样收集积木的
This is how it is. This is how I get my bricks.

1240
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:34,000
事实上 我每年都会用乐高拼六幅作品出来
In fact, I spend over six figures annually just on LEGO.

1241
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:36,920
这就差不多用了这房间里的三百万块积木
There's probably 3 million bricks in this room.

1242
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:39,510
我以儿童的玩具为业
I've made a career from a child's toy.

1243
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:43,720
好多次有人和我说我这样有悖商业规则
I've been told at times I'm a sellout

1244
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:47,310
因为我是在用一个品牌来塑造我的作品
because I use this commercial brand to create my art.

1245
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:50,190
但我选了这个牌子 因为我相信
But it's a brand that I chose because I believe

1246
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:52,110
有了它 我无所不能
there's nothing I can't build out of it.

1247
00:58:55,190 --> 00:58:59,280
我曾经买过很多的乐高积木作玩具
Growing up, I had a lot of LEGO bricks as a toy.

1248
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:01,620
我父母也鼓励我这么做
It was something my parents encouraged.

1249
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:06,580
他们在客厅里留出了一块三平米多的空间让我搭积木
They let me have a 36-square-foot LEGO city in our living room.

1250
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:10,040
我十岁左右的时候 想养只狗
It was when I was about 10 years old, wanted to get a dog.

1251
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,960
于是去问我父母 "我能养只狗吗"
Asked my parents, "Can I get a dog?"

1252
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:13,420
"不 你不可以养狗"
"No, you're not getting a dog."

1253
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,840
于是我捣毁了整个乐高城市
I tore down my LEGO city,

1254
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:20,340
用那些积木拼出了一只真实尺寸的乐高狗
used those bricks to create my own life-size LEGO dog.

1255
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:21,790
那是我第一次
It was really my first time in

1256
00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:24,050
意识到不是积木盒子上画着什么你就要照着拼出什么
realizing it's not what's on the front of the box.

1257
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:27,180
你可以充分发挥创造力 拼出任何你想要的东西
You can actually create whatever you want out of this toy.

1258
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:28,610
我从大学毕业之后
I got out of college,

1259
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:31,600
社会压力很大 很难找到工作
and I had societal pressures to get a real job.

1260
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:34,820
我最终去念了法学院 从事公司法
And I ended up going to law school. I was doing corporate law.

1261
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:36,480
一天结束之后 我回到家
And I would come home at the end of the day

1262
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:38,190
还可以有个宣泄创意的地方
and I would need a creative outlet.

1263
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:40,700
有时候涂涂画画
And sometimes that was drawing, sometimes it was painting.

1264
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:43,660
但我一旦开始积木雕塑
But once I started doing sculptures out of LEGO,

1265
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:46,740
我就找到了自己的激情所在
I really had found my passion.

1266
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:47,760
好像又回到了
And it got to the point

1267
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,620
我在律所工作了一天的时候
where I was working full days at the law firm,

1268
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:51,330
晚上我回到家
and I would come home at night

1269
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:53,670
还有无数的工作还有繁重的工作等着我
and have a slate of commissions to work on.

1270
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:55,380
我想要改变什么
And I decided to make that change,

1271
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:59,510
放弃法律 去当一名艺术家
to leave the law practice behind, and go be an artist.

1272
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:01,260
做一个和玩具厮混在一起的艺术家
An artist who plays with toys.

1273
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,010
你懂的吧 我不知道…我是不是真的有了那个突破点
You know, I don't know if this is... if I've broken through.

1274
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:08,050
我不知道一个艺术家
I don't know if an artist

1275
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:09,600
会不会感受到那个突破点
ever can feel like they've broken through

1276
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:12,600
因为我在不断地设置越来越高远的目标
because I keep setting bigger and bigger goals.

1277
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:16,690
南森的眼前摆着一个绝无仅有的好机会
Nathan has been offered his biggest opportunity yet.

1278
01:00:16,770 --> 01:00:19,820
他在纽约的时代广场预约了一场个人展览
He's been booked for a one-man show in New York's Times Square

1279
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:22,780
并为此准备了很久
and is prepping over a hundred pieces for it.

1280
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:25,000
纽约展览会
The New York exhibition, I think,

1281
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,330
这将是我人生里目前为止最重大的一次展出
will be the biggest show of my life,

1282
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:29,830
是数年精粹的凝聚
a culmination of years' worth of work,

1283
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:34,000
也是史上最大的一次乐高展示会
as well as the largest solo LEGO art exhibition ever.

1284
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:36,710
压力自然很大
And there's a lot of pressure.

1285
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:40,380
展出会重点突出南森自己的创意
The show will feature Nathan's original creations

1286
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:44,010
也有一些他用乐高积木仿制的艺术巨作的展出
as well as LEGO replicas he is making of classical works of art.

1287
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:49,350
对于南森来说 这是一个
For Nathan, this is the opportunity

1288
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:52,350
证明自己是个真正艺术家的好机会
to prove himself as a legitimate artist.

1289
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:56,230
我有点担心这个地点
I'm worried that the venue that's taking a big risk on me

1290
01:00:56,310 --> 01:00:57,940
会搞砸这场展出
feels like this is a failure.

1291
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:01,030
我就是担心 观众们在这种形式下看到展出的时候
I'm worried that, you know, will they actually get it

1292
01:01:01,110 --> 01:01:04,320
还会不会体会到里面的精粹所在
when they see it in the exhibition format?

1293
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:06,870
而且 公众们又会怎么想?
And really, what's the public going to think?

1294
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:13,580
千里之外的德国 另一个艺术家简·弗门
Thousands of miles away in Germany, another artist, Jan Vormann,

1295
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,000
带着他的乐高走上了街头
has taken LEGO arts to the streets.

1296
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,130
我很喜欢带着那些已经在大家头脑中
I really like to work with objects

1297
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:27,840
留下过深刻印象的东西一起玩
that everybody has a preconceived image of.

1298
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:31,640
与有趣的东西一起工作的好处就是
The good thing with playful elements in the work is that

1299
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:35,770
人们很容易被吸引 而不是排斥它们
people get attracted by it rather than repulsed.

1300
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:38,710
艺术家

1301
01:01:35,850 --> 01:01:37,810
如果大家看到一件他们喜欢的东西
If I use a material which people like,

1302
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:43,030
他们就会更倾向于和我交流
they are more likely to start interacting with me.

1303
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:48,780
现在 这种思想可以从两个方面来解读
So now it has different aspects to it.

1304
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:50,780
一个是在雕塑的建设过程中
On the one side, the sculpture installation,

1305
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:53,330
人们可以从视觉的角度去享受它的美感
where it's just there to be visually perceived.

1306
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:56,870
另一方面 就是和我们的行动有关了
And on the other side, a performance kind of action.

1307
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,570
看上去很有趣吧
It looks like a lot of fun,

1308
01:01:59,570 --> 01:02:01,840
但是简的工作基调是十分严肃的
but Jan's work has serious undertones.

1309
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,380
大多时候我会刻意去寻找一些
Most of the times I tried to find locations

1310
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:07,380
有历史背景的地方
which have a kind of historical background

1311
01:02:07,470 --> 01:02:09,970
政治背景亦可
or political meaning.

1312
01:02:10,050 --> 01:02:13,430
现在我们是在安哈尔特火车站的后身
Today we are here in the very back of the Anhalter Bahnhof.

1313
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,940
这里曾是柏林最大的火车站
This used to be the main train station for Berlin.

1314
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:19,100
同样也是在二战结束之前
This is also a place where a lot of Jews were deported

1315
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:20,770
无数犹太人被驱逐出境的地方
before the war ended.

1316
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:24,440
大屠杀在我的脑海里根深蒂固
The Holocaust is an event that's omnipresent in my mind,

1317
01:02:24,530 --> 01:02:25,940
我常常会去想它
so I think about it a lot.

1318
01:02:26,030 --> 01:02:27,990
在我的作品上通常你看不到这些
You don't necessarily see it in my work,

1319
01:02:28,070 --> 01:02:29,820
因为我不想
because I don't want to add like,

1320
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:33,370
把整个画风阴沉化
visually dark and heavy subjects.

1321
01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:37,160
所以我想出了用塑料积木的这样一种方法
So my idea to use the plastic construction bricks

1322
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:42,290
为当代增添一抹色彩
was to add a kind of colorful part of contemporary times,

1323
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:46,130
这是一种能引起全世界人共鸣的方式
a material that everybody worldwide has the same feeling on it.

1324
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,470
一些人把这种行为艺术称为"乐高炸弹"
Some people call this type of art "LEGO bombing,"

1325
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:53,140
但是简将它誉为"补丁工程"
but Jan prefers to call it "Patchwork,"

1326
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:56,770
带着它走向世界
and he's bringing the patchwork project around the world.

1327
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:55,700
洛桑 瑞士

1328
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:57,670
基多 厄瓜多尔

1329
01:02:57,670 --> 01:03:00,000
特拉维夫 以色列

1330
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,840
台北 台湾

1331
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:05,110
对于我来说 看到大家都有相同的文化底蕴
For me, it's a kind of hopeful thing

1332
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:08,400
其实是件让人抱有希冀的事情
to see that we actually share this common culture.

1333
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,700
哇
Whoa...

1334
01:03:15,790 --> 01:03:19,210
如果你想创造出来的东西
Okay. What happens when the thing you want to build

1335
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:21,120
没能问世 但取而代之地
isn't the thing that you want to build but rather

1336
01:03:21,210 --> 01:03:23,880
你创造出来了另外一件能代表它的东西?
a representation of the thing that you want to build?

1337
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:26,210
好吧 我觉得我把自己绕进去了
Okay, I think I just confused myself.

1338
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:30,220
如果你想要做出来的那个东西只是个抽象的想法呢?
What if the thing you want to build is just an idea?

1339
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:32,470
乐高积木能表现出来这个想法吗?
Could LEGO bricks be used for that?

1340
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,080
在丹麦 某个工程师
In Denmark, when a rising

1341
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:37,810
要是想拿下一个大工程的建造权
architect wanted to submit for a major commission,

1342
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:39,940
他会考虑一下
he looked at how modular building techniques

1343
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:41,900
模块建造技术在这个国家的发展状况
had become in his home country

1344
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:44,400
也会想到孩提时代最珍爱的玩具
and thought of his favorite toy as a child.

1345
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,150
在丹麦 因为低薪资
In Denmark, because of the labor wages

1346
01:03:45,050 --> 01:03:48,510
建筑师

1347
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:48,320
与坏天气的原因
and because of the bad weather,

1348
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,450
你想尽可能地减少工程运作的时间
you want to minimize the time at the construction site.

1349
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:52,950
所以各种细节
So everything has to be

1350
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:55,780
都要提前设计好 再别具匠心地组合起来
like prefabricated elements, put together in interesting ways.

1351
01:03:55,870 --> 01:03:59,330
如此看来 丹麦
So in a manner of speaking, Denmark has become

1352
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:01,120
似乎成为了乐高的王国
a country entirely built out of LEGO.

1353
01:04:02,670 --> 01:04:04,840
所以 我们想 如果是真的
So, we thought, like, if that's the truth,

1354
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:07,380
我们应该向乐高致敬
why don't we make this project an homage,

1355
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:09,210
所以我们将这个项目称作乐高塔
so we nicknamed the project the LEGO Towers

1356
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:10,840
我们觉得 最好的方式
and thought the best way to communicate it

1357
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:13,010
就是把它用乐高积木建造出来
would be to build it out of LEGO.

1358
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:18,810
这个主意听上去
And the idea became almost like doing manmade mountains

1359
01:04:18,890 --> 01:04:20,520
像是愚公移山
that are pixilated,

1360
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:24,860
像是在人造一座低分辨率的阿尔卑斯山脉
like a sort of low resolution alpine architecture.

1361
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:27,610
为了向开发商说明完成这个项目有多么容易
To show the developer how easy it was to build the project,

1362
01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:28,820
在我们作陈述的时候
when we presented the project,

1363
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:31,150
我们拿出了它的乐高模型
we also presented this LEGO model and sort of,

1364
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,710
如果你可以用乐高搭出来它的模样
if you can build it out of LEGO,

1365
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:34,320
那么这个工程还能难到哪里去啊
it can't be that difficult, can it?

1366
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:36,280
然后他
And sort of he--

1367
01:04:36,370 --> 01:04:39,200
他把这个模型递给了他的儿子
he passed the LEGO model on to his son,

1368
01:04:39,290 --> 01:04:41,500
我们就这样拿到了建造权
and we got the commission.

1369
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:44,620
这项工程为比亚克的团队赢得了不少赞誉
The project earned Bjarke's group a lot of critical acclaim

1370
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:47,840
还为他在国际工程圈子里竖起了标杆
and helped put him on the international architecture map.

1371
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,590
所以 在乐高公司想找人
So, when the LEGO company was looking for someone to design

1372
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:52,170
在比隆建一栋乐高房子的时候
their LEGO house in Billund,

1373
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:54,260
比亚克毫无疑问是最佳人选
Bjarke was the perfect choice.

1374
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:56,890
当然 我们接到这个消息的时候是很激动的
Of course, we were incredibly excited to get the job.

1375
01:04:56,970 --> 01:05:01,140
所有丹麦人都知道 乐高是丹麦的牌子
As all Danes know, LEGO is a Danish product.

1376
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:05,020
如果我的公司只为了一个目的而生
If BIG had been founded with a single purpose,

1377
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:08,440
那么这个目的一定就是为了拿下乐高房子这个项目
it would be to be the architects of the LEGO house.

1378
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:12,860
在剑桥的麻省理工学院 他们不仅仅在
In Cambridge, at MIT, they're using LEGO elements

1379
01:05:08,550 --> 01:05:10,800
剑桥 麻省

1380
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:14,990
建筑上施加乐高的元素
to visualize more than just buildings.

1381
01:05:15,070 --> 01:05:17,320
他们在意的是整个城市的运行
They're looking at how entire cities work.

1382
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:21,950
我们现在看到的是肯德尔广场的
So, we're looking at a LEGO model that has been constructed

1383
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:25,330
乐高缩略模型
to represent a square kilometer of Kendall Square.

1384
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:27,330
我们现在真的站在这里
We're actually in this building right here,

1385
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:31,000
在麻省理工的媒体实验室里 放眼望去
in the MIT Media Lab, and overlaid on this,

1386
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:34,050
你可以看到谷歌街区的投射影像
you're actually seeing a projection map of Google streets.

1387
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:36,680
麻省理工的城市科学倡议协会
The MIT City Science Initiative

1388
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:39,470
运用乐高的元素将风向
is using LEGO elements to visualize wind patterns,

1389
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:44,020
热图像 光线 与交通流向可视化
heat maps, light studies, and traffic flow.

1390
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:47,060
想看看如果这块积木得到更多的光线的话会发生什么吗
Want to see what happens if this block gets more light?

1391
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:50,020
把那个十层高的楼拔起来
Just pick that 10-story building up and move it.

1392
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:52,070
这个城市各个角落的复杂性
It all kind of highlights the complexity

1393
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:54,110
得以呈现
of the organism that is the city.

1394
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,990
你知道的 城市不仅仅有街道
You know, the city isn't just roads.

1395
01:05:56,070 --> 01:05:57,860
不是只与阳光有联系
It's not just access to sun.

1396
01:05:57,950 --> 01:06:01,450
在交通网络里 也不是只有人流的涌动
It's not just people moving, within the transportation networks.

1397
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,660
万物万象 在同一地点存在着
It's all of these things, in the same place,

1398
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:05,500
是极难被发现的
and that's incredibly hard to see.

1399
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:09,040
它给了所有人 非专家们与半专家们
It allows everyone, let's say, non-expert and expert alike

1400
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:12,210
在同一平台共事的机会
to come together on a simple platform, you know,

1401
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:14,970
能加入其中 在有意义的交流中占有一席之地
that's inviting, to be for engagement,

1402
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:16,510
是件很有魅力的事情
you know, in a meaningful conversation.

1403
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:19,010
哇
Huh, wow.

1404
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:22,510
看来乐高能帮我们解决交通问题了
Turns out LEGO bricks might solve our traffic problems.

1405
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,890
在巴西圣保罗的贫民区
In the favelas of Sao Paulo, Brazil,

1406
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:26,040
圣保罗 巴西

1407
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:27,520
他们甚至将这种视化工具升华到了另一个层次
they've taken this visualization tool to the next level

1408
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,900
他们用它来讨论想法
by using it to discuss ideas,

1409
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:33,230
一些关于社会与阶层的抽象想法
abstract ideas about community and class.

1410
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:38,360
我们想要求他们用乐高建设模型
We challenged them to build model cities in LEGOs,

1411
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:42,200
这些建筑得以兴建
and these constructions arise out of

1412
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:44,200
是因为孩子们找到了
the children's search for

1413
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:46,140
总裁及创始人


1414
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:48,120
解决他们社区生活麻烦的办法
solutions in the community in which they're living.

1415
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:51,840
这是我们的社区 我们的生存空间
This is our community. Our space.

1416
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:55,210
所有你可以想象到的东西都正在这些河流中腐烂着
Every rotten thing that you can imagine is in these rivers.

1417
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:59,050
我们的朋友想搭一座桥
It was our friend who had the idea to build a bridge

1418
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:01,590
借此来向社会表明它会带来什么不同
to show the difference in our society,

1419
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,850
这也使我们得以在一个更高远的角度来看待问题
and it made us take a bigger view of things.

1420
01:07:03,930 --> 01:07:08,100
这显示出了改变的力量
It's showing them that the power of change,

1421
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:10,810
它虽起源于一闪而过的念头
the power of an idea that begins small,

1422
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:13,110
却如此具有影响力
can sometimes have a large effect.

1423
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:17,610
乐高作为工具来看 还有另一种使用途径
There's another way the LEGO system is being used as a tool,

1424
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,410
这也大概是最赋予它意义的一种途径
and perhaps the most profound of all.

1425
01:07:21,450 --> 01:07:23,700
玩具也可以起到治疗效果吗
Can a toy be therapeutic?

1426
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:24,270
樱桃山 新泽西州

1427
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:29,580
在新泽西州的樱桃山的耶鲁学校里
At the Yale School in Cherry Hill, New Jersey,

1428
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:32,540
孩子们通过乐高积木在与彼此交流
kids are interacting with each other, playing with LEGO bricks.

1429
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:37,300
这常见之景却一点都不平常
What seems ordinary is actually quite extraordinary.

1430
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:39,970
这是一所为自闭症儿童开设的学校
This school is for kids with autism,

1431
01:07:40,050 --> 01:07:42,050
学校里所有的孩子都有
and all of these kids have

1432
01:07:42,050 --> 01:07:45,430
严重的精神系统缺陷
significant neurodevelopmental disabilities.

1433
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:47,240
二十年前丹·勒高夫博士创设了一种疗法
They're part of a therapy

1434
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:50,270
孩子们都是这种疗法的受众
developed two decades ago by Dr. Dan Legoff.

1435
01:07:50,350 --> 01:07:52,350
是的 这就是他的真名
And, yeah, that's his real name.

1436
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:54,230
我是在找别的东西
I was looking for something else.

1437
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,410
我对这些
I wasn't happy with the

1438
01:07:55,410 --> 01:07:57,610
用标准化方法得到的结果不太满意
outcomes I was getting using standard methods.

1439
01:07:57,690 --> 01:08:01,400
所以我在娱乐室里放了几张台子
And so I had, you know, different stations in my playroom.

1440
01:07:58,090 --> 01:08:02,600
自闭症治疗师

1441
01:08:01,490 --> 01:08:03,820
其中一张上面放着乐高
One of them, um, was LEGO.

1442
01:08:03,910 --> 01:08:06,620
很多孩子
And a lot of the kids, especially,

1443
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:08,620
特别是那些对于社交感到焦虑的 害羞的
socially anxious, inhibited,

1444
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:12,290
安静的 还有那些患有轻微自闭症的孩子们
quiet, mildly autistic kind of kids,

1445
01:08:12,370 --> 01:08:14,290
都被乐高吸引住了
gravitated to the LEGO area.

1446
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:18,710
看上去那里就是一片无焦虑的小天地
And it seemed like an anxiety-free zone.

1447
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,000
灵感始于那天
The "A-ha" Moment came

1448
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,340
我走进等候室的时候
one day when I came out to the waiting room

1449
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:24,340
看到两个孩子
and two kids that I had been seeing,

1450
01:08:24,430 --> 01:08:26,640
性格十分相似
very similar personalities...

1451
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:29,600
他们都从家里带来乐高要给我看
they were both bringing LEGOs from home to show me.

1452
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:31,530
两个人在等候室里相遇了
And they had met in the waiting room,

1453
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:33,190
他们便转而向对方展示自己的积木
and they were showing each other.

1454
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:36,360
他们的父母激动极了
And their parents were excited.

1455
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:38,940
你能想象得到吧 他们欢呼道 "快看啊
You could tell, they were like, "Whoa. Look at that.

1456
01:08:39,030 --> 01:08:41,280
他们在交流 在沟通啊 太棒了"
They're communicating. They're interacting. This is cool."

1457
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:43,990
勒高夫博士允许孩子们玩乐高
Dr. Legoff allowed the kids to play with LEGO toys,

1458
01:08:44,070 --> 01:08:46,870
前提是要求他们一起玩
but only if they built together.

1459
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:49,490
三人一组 一个人是工程师
Working in groups of three, one is the engineer,

1460
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:52,870
一个人负责提供材料 另外一个负责搭建
one is the parts supplier, and one is the builder.

1461
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:56,750
只有交流 他们才能搭出一件完整的作品
Only by communicating can they get to a finished product.

1462
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:59,130
很好
Good.

1463
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:00,340
是时候转换一下角色了
This is a good time to switch.

1464
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:04,180
谁还没有搭吗 这次到你了
Anybody who hasn't done building yet should take a turn now.

1465
01:09:00,570 --> 01:09:04,910
自闭症治疗师

1466
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:05,800
整个过程进展得非常好
It's coming along real nice.

1467
01:09:05,890 --> 01:09:08,140
奥秘就在于让他们以集体的形式
Making them do a systematic thing

1468
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:10,810
去做一件系统的事情
in a social context is the trick.

1469
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:12,850
搭乐高是件很酷的事情 但是和我朋友一起搭
Building LEGOs is cool, but you know what's even better

1470
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:14,560
就更酷了
is to do it with my friends.

1471
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:16,400
看见这种方法奏效了 我真是太开心了
It is so exciting to see this thing working.

1472
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:19,400
我的一个学生 他在乐高俱乐部里
So I have one student who interacts with other kids

1473
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:22,860
与其他孩子一天的交流量
in the LEGO club much more just in that one day,

1474
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:24,900
已经远远超过了他与这个俱乐部之外的孩子们的交流量
than he has interacted with kids outside of LEGO club

1475
01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:26,240
一整个夏天都是如此
for the whole summer.

1476
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:28,030
-是吗  -这是个很重大的发现
- Right. - So that's a pretty big deal.

1477
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:30,700
父母们都在这样说 "我们的孩子特别喜欢去找丹博士
Parents were saying, "Oh, my kid loves going to see Dr. Dan.

1478
01:09:30,790 --> 01:09:33,410
这不是很好吗 他终于有了一个他喜欢的疗法
Isn't that great? He finally has a therapy that he enjoys.

1479
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:35,460
他好像比以前更善于交际了"
He seems to be getting better socially."

1480
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:37,630
但是没有具体数据
But there was no data on it.

1481
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:40,170
勒高夫博士进行了科学研究
Dr. Legoff conducted a scientific study

1482
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:42,260
对传统疗法和他的疗法
comparing the behavioral improvements

1483
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:44,970
所导致的行为上的进步进行了比较
from his therapy versus traditional therapy.

1484
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:47,090
那些接受传统疗法的孩子确实有改善
Now those kids did get better.

1485
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:51,180
但玩乐高的孩子比他们的改善显著的多
But the LEGO kids got significantly better than they did.

1486
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:57,230
艾德里安·皮特来自纽约
One of the many kids who has benefitted

1487
01:09:57,310 --> 01:10:00,520
是众多受益于这种疗法的孩子之一
from this kind of therapy is Adrian Pitt, of New York City.

1488
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:17,210
乐高玩具要求的就是集中精力
LEGOs are usually all about concentration.

1489
01:10:17,290 --> 01:10:20,500
我需要专注于更多的东西
And I need to concentrate on something a bit more.

1490
01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:23,090
这帮助了我 比如 更专心
It helps me, like, focus.

1491
01:10:23,170 --> 01:10:24,550
为什么不把帽子摘下来呢
Why don't you take off...

1492
01:10:24,630 --> 01:10:28,590
艾德里安他是个好孩子
Adrian is... He's just a real nice kid

1493
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:30,680
他想交更多的朋友 也想玩
who wants to make friends and wants to play.

1494
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:33,720
他患有语言迟缓症
He has speech and language delays,

1495
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:33,790
艾德里安妈妈

1496
01:10:33,810 --> 01:10:36,480
3岁的时候就开始
and he has been in speech and language therapy

1497
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:39,270
进行语言方面的治疗
since he was about three years old.

1498
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,730
乐高的优越之处
The great thing about LEGO, and the reason

1499
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:44,550
艾德里安爸爸

1500
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:46,320
和我如此喜爱给儿子玩的原因
that I love it for him so much is there's no words.

1501
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:47,990
正在于乐高不需要文字 它的指示是图片
The instructions are the pictures.

1502
01:10:48,070 --> 01:10:51,240
所以只要你能看见
So if you can see,

1503
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:54,580
就可以遵循指示来完成乐高
you know, you can follow directions and you can complete LEGOs.

1504
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:56,830
有些零件需要测量
Some of these pieces need to have measurements,

1505
01:10:56,910 --> 01:11:00,830
比如这块要求整好7毫米
so this one needs to be exactly seven millimeters.

1506
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:02,920
这是我们测量的方法
This is how we measure.

1507
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,170
艾德里安对他的建造感到很骄傲
Adrian's very proud of what he built.

1508
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:08,010
有一种真实存在的成就感
There's a real sense of accomplishment

1509
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:12,680
他完成的建造 对他而言都很重要
once he's finished something, and that's a big deal for him.

1510
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:18,230
我安装这块遇到了点麻烦
I'm having a bit of trouble attaching this part.

1511
01:11:18,310 --> 01:11:20,850
如果我不能正确安置它 就没办法成功
If I don't get it right, then it's not going to work.

1512
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:26,900
在长岛的一个秘密基地
In a secret location in Long Island,

1513
01:11:26,990 --> 01:11:29,610
真人大小的X-翼战机模型的组件
the components of the life-size X-Wing model

1514
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:31,930
艾斯利普 纽约州

1515
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:32,450
已经通过来自捷克共和国的货船运达
have arrived via freighter from the Czech Republic.

1516
01:11:32,530 --> 01:11:33,910
X-翼战机必须被完全组装
The X-Wing must be fully assembled,

1517
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:36,450
然后分解为5个运输原件
then broken up into five transportable pieces

1518
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:40,290
运送到纽约时代广场进行揭幕仪式
to be brought to New York City for its unveiling in Times Square.

1519
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:41,620
时间不多了
There isn't much time.

1520
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:43,840
我们终于到纽约了
We are finally in New York.

1521
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:46,170
快要到最后的舞台了
We are really near to final stage.

1522
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:49,720
再有几周的事了 就开始了
And it's just a couple of weeks more, and that's it.

1523
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:49,780
生产部经理 乐高公司

1524
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,720
你可以把它想象为一个巨大的儿童卧室
You can imagine this being a giant kid's bedroom,

1525
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,390
然后我们刚刚打开了一箱砖
and we've just opened up the box of bricks,

1526
01:11:55,470 --> 01:11:58,100
我们已经有序的安排过每一部分了 现在开始组装了
and we've organized our parts and now we're assembling it,

1527
01:11:58,180 --> 01:11:59,730
和在家完成很像
a lot like you would at home.

1528
01:11:59,810 --> 01:12:02,270
除了这里的规模更大
Except we're just doing it on a massive scale here.

1529
01:11:59,810 --> 01:12:02,330
项目主管 乐高公司

1530
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,780
这里的组装
How is this project different

1531
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:12,160
与在家完成的有什么不同
from maybe the one that you build in your bedroom?

1532
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:14,280
这里有重型设备负责起降
Here we have heavy equipment for lifting

1533
01:12:14,370 --> 01:12:17,700
5000磅和8000磅的零件
5,000-pound pieces and 8,000-pound pieces.

1534
01:12:17,790 --> 01:12:21,080
而且家中的模型里估计没有钢
And you probably don't have steel inside your models at home.

1535
01:12:27,170 --> 01:12:30,970
我们规划了日程 但就算拆开这些零件
We are on schedule, but it's-- even just unpacking the pieces,

1536
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:34,970
也不是5分钟能搞定的 要花半天时间
it's not like in five minutes. It takes like half a day.

1537
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:39,140
什么都需要时间 所有事加起来要几天的时间
It takes time. We need a couple of days for everything.

1538
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,610
好的 完成了
All right, I think we got it now.

1539
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,450
这个先来 就放那
This first, it stays where it is.

1540
01:12:55,530 --> 01:12:59,080
然后 引擎 最后放其他翼
Second, the engine. And then the rest of the wing.

1541
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,120
太酷了
It's cool.

1542
01:13:04,210 --> 01:13:06,710
瞧 X-翼星战士
Behold, the X-Wing star fighter.

1543
01:13:07,710 --> 01:13:09,920
组装完成了
With the assembly complete,

1544
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:12,340
现在是最大的挑战是
now comes the biggest challenge of all,

1545
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:14,050
把真实大小的X-翼战机在无人发觉的前提下
bringing a life-size X-Wing

1546
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:17,050
运送到美国最繁华的街区
into the busiest block in America without detection.

1547
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:22,480
今天是周三 情况也许没有想象的那么糟
Today is Wednesday. It might not be that bad.

1548
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:25,100
但是我们要到纽约的心脏去 所以
But we're going to the heart of New York, so...

1549
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,500
前方还是有挑战
There are still challenges in front of us

1550
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:52,340
因为我们只有最后一晚了
because we have only night until morning.

1551
01:13:56,890 --> 01:13:59,430
嗯 我们的计划是花整个晚上
Well, our plan is to spend the whole night

1552
01:13:59,510 --> 01:14:01,510
来组装它 把它们安在一起
assembling it, putting it together,

1553
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,980
早晨6点的时候 推回来然后藏在盒子里
and at 6 A.M., roll it back and hide it inside the box.

1554
01:14:40,850 --> 01:14:45,680
现在是早上7点 我们搞定了
It's seven in the morning, and it's done.

1555
01:14:50,690 --> 01:14:53,980
艾德里安的爸爸会带他来曼哈顿中城
Adrian's father is bringing him into Midtown Manhattan

1556
01:14:54,070 --> 01:14:55,780
给他一份特殊惊喜
for a special surprise.

1557
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:01,240
上面写什么
What does it say?

1558
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:02,740
秘密模型 不可毁坏的箱子
Secret model. Indestructible box.

1559
01:15:05,950 --> 01:15:09,960
现场有乐高迷吗
Do we have any LEGO fans here?

1560
01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:13,380
有人想知道箱子里是什么吗
Does anyone here want to know what's inside that box?

1561
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:15,800
-有  -听不到
- Yes! - I can't hear you!

1562
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:18,590
我说 "有人想知道箱子里是什么吗"
I said, "Do you want to know what's inside that box?"

1563
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:20,930
想
Yes!

1564
01:15:21,010 --> 01:15:23,850
大家都伸出手臂来
I want you guys to stretch your arms out all the way

1565
01:15:23,930 --> 01:15:25,350
利用臂力和尤达的力量
to harness the power of the

1566
01:15:25,350 --> 01:15:27,560
来开启这个箱子
Force along with Yoda to open up this box.

1567
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:32,290
准备好了吗 一 二 三
Ready? One... two... three!

1568
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:43,740
X-翼战机
X-Wing!

1569
01:15:52,170 --> 01:15:56,090
这个X翼星际战斗机模型
This X-Wing Starfighter is the largest LEGO model

1570
01:15:56,170 --> 01:15:57,590
是目前为止最大的乐高模型
that has ever been built.

1571
01:15:57,670 --> 01:16:01,180
用了超过500万块乐高积木
I'm talking over five million LEGO bricks.

1572
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:05,160
五百三十三万五千两百块积木
Five million, three hundred, thirty-five thousand, two hundred pieces,

1573
01:16:05,350 --> 01:16:08,140
重四万五磅
and 45,000 pounds.

1574
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:11,060
这是我见过最酷的东西
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen.

1575
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:23,320
三 二 一
Three, two, one.

1576
01:16:32,210 --> 01:16:33,200
同样在纽约
Also in New York,

1577
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:36,000
奈森·萨瓦亚在为他的个人展进行最后的准备
Nathan Sawaya is making last-minute preparations

1578
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:39,590
积木梦工厂
on his one-man show, The Art of the Brick.

1579
01:16:39,670 --> 01:16:41,220
今晚终于开展
It finally opens tonight.

1580
01:16:42,090 --> 01:16:44,090
我很紧张
I am very nervous,

1581
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:46,220
但也很期待看到今晚
but also very excited to see those folks

1582
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:48,760
第一次穿过这道门的人们
walk through the door for the first time tonight.

1583
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:52,310
这里是积木梦工厂
This is The Art of the Brick.

1584
01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:54,560
这是我举办过的最大型展览
This is my largest exhibition I've ever done,

1585
01:16:54,650 --> 01:16:56,190
也恰巧是
and it just happens to be

1586
01:16:56,190 --> 01:16:58,770
个人举办的最大乐高展
the largest solo LEGO art exhibition ever.

1587
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:08,240
把乐高带入当代艺术世界是我的目标
I had a goal of taking LEGO into the contemporary art world,

1588
01:17:08,330 --> 01:17:11,080
为了实现它
and to do so, it had to be done in a way

1589
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:15,540
我必须全身心地投入进去
where I was really putting myself and my soul into the work.

1590
01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:31,390
我都想变成墙上的苍蝇
You know, part of me wants to just be a fly on the wall

1591
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,390
来听听大家的反应
and listen to people's reaction.

1592
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:35,520
我会尽量这么做的
And I'm going to try and do that as much as possible.

1593
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:39,320
嗯 我们拭目以待吧
So, um, we'll see what happens.

1594
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:44,950
好的 谢谢你
There it is, thank you.

1595
01:17:45,030 --> 01:17:47,870
第一反应直接被惊呆了
First impression, I just got blown away.

1596
01:17:47,950 --> 01:17:51,830
没想过能感受到如此巨大的灵感
I didn't expect to feel this much inspiration.

1597
01:17:51,910 --> 01:17:54,410
太赞了 我小时候玩过乐高
Amazing. I worked with LEGO when I was a kid,

1598
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:56,460
但都按着图纸做
but I always built things off the back of the packet,

1599
01:17:56,540 --> 01:17:58,670
我从未想过有人把它变成自己脑海中的东西
and I can't believe that someone's actually turned around

1600
01:17:58,750 --> 01:18:01,710
然后做出来展出
and turned it into something from their imagination.

1601
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,720
这是很愉悦有趣的事物
This is something that is delightful and playful,

1602
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:06,630
也是一些可以
and it's something that can really

1603
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:09,430
激发孩子和成人的灵感的东西
spark the imagination in children and adults.

1604
01:18:10,810 --> 01:18:13,060
已经有几个艺术评论家走过去了
We have had a few art critics walk through already,

1605
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:15,890
当然我也很紧张他们会怎么说
and of course I'm nervous to see what they say,

1606
01:18:15,980 --> 01:18:18,350
但我认为只要有主流媒体的
but I think it's almost a compliment

1607
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:20,690
专业艺术评论家过来
just to have a serious art critic from some

1608
01:18:20,770 --> 01:18:23,440
就已经是一种赞美了
major newspapers in this country walking through.

1609
01:18:23,530 --> 01:18:26,150
他们不会错认为这只是个玩具展
They were not dismissing it as just a toy display.

1610
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:28,950
这不只是个噱头 这是艺术
It's not just a gimmick. This was art.

1611
01:18:29,030 --> 01:18:30,780
你们怎么看
What do you guys think?

1612
01:18:30,870 --> 01:18:32,740
-我们觉得很棒  -是吧
- I think it's good. - Yeah?

1613
01:18:32,830 --> 01:18:35,410
-是你做的吗  -是 这些都是我做的
- Did you make that? - I did, I made all of these.

1614
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:37,790
这种形式的展览将会把那些
This type of exhibition is going to draw in folks

1615
01:18:37,870 --> 01:18:40,920
从未参观过美术博物馆的人吸引过来
who have never been to an art museum before in their life.

1616
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,130
他们过来是因为对玩具有种熟悉感
And they're coming because they have a familiarity with the toy.

1617
01:18:44,210 --> 01:18:45,630
如果这为他们
And if that opens them up

1618
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:48,880
第一次开启了艺术世界的大门 我就成功了
to the art world for the first time, then I've done my job.

1619
01:18:53,850 --> 01:18:57,230
乐高设计者詹米·贝拉尔德正前往西雅图的乐高积木展
LEGO Designer Jamie Berard is headed to BrickCon in Seattle

1620
01:18:56,710 --> 01:19:00,170
乐高设计师

1621
01:18:57,310 --> 01:19:00,100
为他的新设计巴黎式小餐馆揭幕
to unveil his new Parisian Cafe set.

1622
01:19:00,190 --> 01:19:02,150
但他在那还有另一个任务
But while he's there, he's got another mission.

1623
01:19:02,230 --> 01:19:05,030
这是我们的开心盒 现在我们不知道这里边有什么
These are our happy boxes. Now, we don't know what's in this.

1624
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:06,820
他在说服他的设计师们
He's convinced his fellow designers

1625
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:10,700
与粉丝进行模型构建大赛
to compete against the public in the master build contest.

1626
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:11,820
好的大伙们
Okay, teams.

1627
01:19:11,910 --> 01:19:14,490
这和我们将在华盛顿西雅图的乐高积木展
These are the same products that will be given to LEGO fans

1628
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:16,700
给乐高迷的产品是一样的
at BrickCon in Seattle, Washington.

1629
01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:19,920
我们想让大家真正参与到活动中
And what we want to do is actually participate more in the event

1630
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,300
和乐高迷一起接受挑战
by doing the challenge they

1631
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:23,420
我们先在这实战演示下
will be doing there, we'll be doing it here.

1632
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:25,590
西雅图 华盛顿州

1633
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:26,590
欢迎
Welcome!

1634
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:31,510
好的 你们发现只有25个位置
Okay, you notice there are only 25 stations.

1635
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,510
挑个组员一起坐下吧
Pick a teammate and go sit down.

1636
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:36,640
我觉得乐高积木展大会一定会很有趣
I think it's going to be a lot of fun at the BrickCon convention,

1637
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:39,190
因为当你有机会与设计者当面交锋
because when you have a head-to-head with designers,

1638
01:19:37,210 --> 01:19:40,080
乐高设计师

1639
01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:41,480
你肯定想战胜他们
of course you want to beat them.

1640
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:43,270
好的 我们都有什么
All right, so what do we got here?

1641
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:45,480
-好的 很棒  -我们的角度是什么
- Okay, that's cool. - What is our angle going to be?

1642
01:19:45,570 --> 01:19:48,240
你们可以看到猪和牛的头是因为
The reason that you can see we have pig and cow heads,

1643
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:49,430
今年乐高积木展的主题
is because the theme for

1644
01:19:49,430 --> 01:19:51,320
是猪牛对战
this year's BrickCon is Pigs Versus Cows.

1645
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:56,160
每个人都有两个牛头和猪头吗
Does everyone have two pig heads and two cow heads?

1646
01:19:57,370 --> 01:19:58,830
还有问题吗
Are there any questions?

1647
01:19:58,910 --> 01:20:00,540
-有  -就一个"自己的创作"吗
- Yes. - It's one MOC?

1648
01:19:58,910 --> 01:20:00,540
乐高中的MOC代表着My Own Creation,"我自己的创造"

1649
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:02,710
是一个 但想有多少楼都可以
It's one MOC, but it can be how many buildings you want.

1650
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:04,540
尽可能的构建故事吧
Make up the story as much as you want,

1651
01:20:04,630 --> 01:20:06,300
然后从中获得乐趣
and then have a lot of fun with it.

1652
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:09,590
用所有的零件 所有布景 想要多少都行
Use all the pieces, use all the set, as much as you like.

1653
01:20:09,670 --> 01:20:13,640
你们有一个半小时 准备好了吗
You'll have one and one half hours to build. Are we ready?

1654
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:15,220
好了
Yeah!

1655
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:16,560
开始
Go!

1656
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:32,940
背后的故事是
So, the idea behind this

1657
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:34,990
他们应该为某些东西而战
is that they should be fighting for something.

1658
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:37,950
这是一场战争 或是某种猪牛大战
It's a battle or some type of pigs versus cows.

1659
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:39,920
看吧 总是这样
See, this is always like, you know,

1660
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:41,960
为什么一定要有争斗呢
why does it always have to be battles?

1661
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:44,250
没准哪个赢了才能生存
Maybe whoever wins stays alive.

1662
01:20:44,330 --> 01:20:45,380
-生存  -是的
- Stays alive. - Yeah.

1663
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:52,420
选手们 你们现在
Contestants, you now have

1664
01:20:52,510 --> 01:20:55,760
只有59分51秒了
fifty-nine minutes and fifty-one seconds left!

1665
01:20:55,850 --> 01:20:57,260
压力
Pressure!

1666
01:20:57,350 --> 01:20:59,520
噢 压力 我讨厌在压力下建造东西
Oh, stress! I hate building under stress.

1667
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:05,520
怎么样了 有什么进展
How are things going, what's your process here?

1668
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:07,110
你可以拿任何东西创建任何东西
You can build anything with anything.

1669
01:21:07,190 --> 01:21:08,230
对 对
Right, right.

1670
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:09,780
所以 先想个好故事
So, come up with a good story first,

1671
01:21:09,860 --> 01:21:11,820
然后用零件造出你们想要的故事
and then make the pieces do what you need them to do.

1672
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:13,700
-有意思  -创作一个故事
- Interesting. - Build a story.

1673
01:21:13,780 --> 01:21:16,160
这是我们第一次听到有人这样谈论故事
This is the first time we've heard someone talking about story,

1674
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:18,410
这对这场比赛很重要
which I know was very important in this contest.

1675
01:21:18,490 --> 01:21:20,660
他像个机械牛 所以他是半牛半械
He's like a cyborg. So he's half-cow, half-robot.

1676
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:21,910
-是滴  -是的
- Yeah. - Yes.

1677
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,500
-这是个机械牛  -噢 是个好主意
- It's a "Cowborg." - Oh, that's a good idea.

1678
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:27,960
-我需要更大的角吗  -要啊 多点角
- Do I need bigger horns? - Yeah, much more horny.

1679
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:29,210
你这个猪
You pig.

1680
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:31,570
有些故事
Some of the stories at some

1681
01:21:31,570 --> 01:21:33,590
在某个点变得很荒诞和疯狂
point just got really ridiculous and crazy.

1682
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:35,970
但是 因为我们是去粉丝活动嘛
And yet, because we were going to a fan event,

1683
01:21:36,050 --> 01:21:37,930
比平常的设计更进一步
it was kinda fun to let it almost progress

1684
01:21:38,010 --> 01:21:40,220
也是挺有趣的
a little bit further than we normally would.

1685
01:21:40,310 --> 01:21:42,180
这是个牛牛弹射车
It's a "Cow-tapult."

1686
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:47,940
戴夫 史黛西比赛进行的怎么样了
Dave, Stacy, how's the competition going so far?

1687
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:50,400
我们还剩很多块 但我觉得我们找对方向的
We have a lot of pieces, but I think we're on the right track.

1688
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,610
乔西跟我们讲讲你们的设计呗
Josh, why don't you tell us what you guys are working on?

1689
01:21:52,690 --> 01:21:55,280
我们设计了这个臭名昭彰的小房子
We have a little house of ill repute going on here.

1690
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:57,820
这是个牛牛俱乐部 但猪们进来了
It's a cow club, but the pigs have come in.

1691
01:21:57,910 --> 01:21:59,780
他正在灌木丛边上尿尿
He's relieving himself in the bush right here.

1692
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:02,580
对 他速度超快
Yeah, he's super-fast.

1693
01:22:02,660 --> 01:22:05,000
他在这家伙边上转啊转
He's turning round, round this guy.

1694
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:07,210
我期待有人看到这些然后说
I'm expecting some people to look at them and go...

1695
01:22:07,290 --> 01:22:10,130
来真的吗 这就是你最高水平了
Really? Is this the best you got?

1696
01:22:10,210 --> 01:22:11,420
乐高迷们不知道
The LEGO fans don't know

1697
01:22:11,420 --> 01:22:13,590
他们会与乐高的设计者进行竞争
they'll be competing against LEGO designers

1698
01:22:13,670 --> 01:22:15,510
直到詹米的出现
until Jamie shows up.

1699
01:22:15,590 --> 01:22:17,090
我必须看看你的动物
I just have to look at your animal

1700
01:22:17,180 --> 01:22:20,550
因为我们试图看清你们是怎么做的
because we were trying to see how you did it.

1701
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:23,140
他让我们有点难堪
He's making us look bad.

1702
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:25,940
时间到
Time's up!

1703
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:27,060
我们做完了
We finished.

1704
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:33,110
确保你们的创作设计是你们想要的效果
Make sure your MOC is arranged the way you want it to be seen.

1705
01:22:33,190 --> 01:22:35,990
出门稍候 十分钟以后进来
Step outside and come back in ten minutes.

1706
01:22:57,180 --> 01:22:58,470
恭喜
Congratulations!

1707
01:22:58,550 --> 01:23:00,430
叫他们进来吧 让他们知道发生了什么
Let's bring them in, let them know what's going on.

1708
01:23:01,970 --> 01:23:03,510
你们做得都太棒了
You guys did such a great job,

1709
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:07,560
很难分出谁是冠军
it was really hard to tell who was our champion.

1710
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:11,610
所以 八号 请你站在你的模型旁边好吗
so, Number 8, won't you stand by your MOC, please?

1711
01:23:12,610 --> 01:23:14,150
赢者是八号
Winner is Number 8!

1712
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:17,240
我们基本是分开的 一人建了一个机械
We basically split off. We each built a mech.

1713
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:20,160
我建的是猪械 Chris建的是牛械
So I built the pig mech, and Chris built the cow mech.

1714
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:22,160
所以他们有点像机器人拳击赛
So they're kind of like Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots?

1715
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:24,280
嗯 我们真正喜欢这个创作
Yeah, I think what we really liked about the MOC,

1716
01:23:24,370 --> 01:23:26,450
也是你们赢的原因是
and what made it really win, was the fact that

1717
01:23:26,540 --> 01:23:29,540
你们不仅利用了提供的牛头和猪头
not only did you use the small pig and cow heads here,

1718
01:23:29,620 --> 01:23:32,330
而且用提供的乐高积木
but you also constructed robotic ones from scratch

1719
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:34,000
快速构建了一个机械物
with the bricks you were provided.

1720
01:23:34,090 --> 01:23:37,090
胜者真的 我绝对同意 很杰出
The winner was, I definitely agree-- was really a standout.

1721
01:23:37,170 --> 01:23:38,710
我知道我们的竞争会很激烈
I knew we'd have tough competition.

1722
01:23:38,710 --> 01:23:40,430
这些都是很棒的建造家
These are some really amazing builders.

1723
01:23:40,510 --> 01:23:42,040
我的意思是 我真的认为
I mean, I'd like to think that

1724
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:44,350
我们进了前28就很好了
we came in the top 28, which was pretty good.

1725
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:49,020
模型建结束不多久后
Shortly after the master build,

1726
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:52,690
詹米隆重介绍了巴黎式小餐馆套装
Jamie introduces the new Parisian Cafe set to much fanfare.

1727
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:56,800
然后参与者都集聚到
Then participants gather in

1728
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,150
中央大厅来进行年度颁奖庆典
the main hall for the annual award ceremony.

1729
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:02,240
爱丽丝·芬奇的瑞文戴尔被选出为
Alice Finch's Rivendell build is being considered

1730
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:04,370
梦寐以求的人民选择奖
for the coveted People's Choice Award.

1731
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:09,960
人民选择奖是由公众投票的
The People's Choice Awards are those voted upon by the public.

1732
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,330
我们计算所有选票 然后得出
We counted all those up, and we came up with

1733
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:13,920
人民选择奖的得主
Winners of People's Choice.

1734
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,040
获奖作品是
And the winner is...

1735
01:24:16,710 --> 01:24:18,170
瑞文戴尔
Rivendell!

1736
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:27,140
有一万人为喜欢你的作品
It's a pretty amazing feeling to have

1737
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:29,480
这是一种很赞的感觉
10,000 people say that they like what you build.

1738
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:32,640
女人获奖不很普遍
To have a woman win is pretty unusual.

1739
01:24:32,730 --> 01:24:36,690
连续三年都是同一个人的还没有听过
To have the same person win three years in a row is unheard of.

1740
01:24:44,530 --> 01:24:47,660
了解人类和我们的历史
One of the fundamental ways we know about humans

1741
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:49,950
一种很基础的方式就是看他们建造的东西
and our history is by the things that they build.

1742
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:54,040
也许一些小的塑料砖块是新时代的一种适应
Maybe little plastic bricks are a modern adaptation of that,

1743
01:24:54,130 --> 01:24:57,590
但本质是建造东西
but really it's about creating something.

1744
01:24:57,670 --> 01:25:02,630
我们触碰到的绝对是人类的核心
We are definitely at the core of what is human,

1745
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:04,470
就是建造东西的能力
is the capacity to build.

1746
01:25:05,180 --> 01:25:09,220
从大局来看 地球上的生物已经进化了几千年
In the big picture, life on Earth has evolved through millennia

1747
01:25:09,310 --> 01:25:11,810
来适应周遭环境
by adapting to the surroundings,

1748
01:25:11,890 --> 01:25:15,900
直到某一点 我们制造了工具 科技
until the point where we invent tools, technology.

1749
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:21,860
我们突然得到了适应我们生活环境的能力
We suddenly get the capacity to adapt our surroundings to life.

1750
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:23,950
所以我们不必再寻找可以容身的穴洞
So we now no longer have to suffice

1751
01:25:24,030 --> 01:25:27,240
或是可以爬上的树木
with a cave we can find or a tree we can climb into.

1752
01:25:27,330 --> 01:25:29,120
我们可以建造自己的洞穴
We can actually build our own cave,

1753
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:31,200
可以建自己的树屋
and we can build our own tree house.

1754
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:33,830
当我们拥有这种能力的瞬间
The moment where we really became human

1755
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:36,000
就是我们成为真正人类的时候
was the moment where we got this power.

1756
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:37,500
这也是一种心态
It's also a mindset somehow.

1757
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:39,380
就是相信只要手边有工具
It's believing that anything is possible

1758
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:41,260
那么凡事皆有可能
if you have the right tools in front of you.

1759
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:44,470
有时候我们没有机会去自由的抒发
Sometimes we don't have an opportunity to just be free,

1760
01:25:44,550 --> 01:25:47,220
我们内心的世界
and everything that we have inside of us,

1761
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:49,510
从没有机会真正得以释放
we never have an opportunity to let it out.

1762
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:53,270
我们一直在寻找启发我们
And we're always looking for something to inspire us

1763
01:25:53,350 --> 01:25:55,690
或是给予我们快乐的东西
or to just give us some joy.

1764
01:25:55,770 --> 01:25:59,310
能让我们心中的梦和思想
Being able to take your dreams and take your thoughts

1765
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:01,280
变得实体化
and materialize into something,

1766
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:02,900
这是个美妙的礼物
it's just a wonderful gift,

1767
01:26:02,990 --> 01:26:05,490
我认为乐高积木给予世界这样的礼物
and I think the LEGO brick has given that to the world.

1768
01:26:10,370 --> 01:26:13,290
在爱达荷州 乔纳森和马特马上完成
In Idaho, Jonathan and Matt are nearly finished editing

1769
01:26:13,370 --> 01:26:15,870
他们的杰作《熔点》
their masterpiece, Melting Point.

1770
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:19,920
X翼战机已经永久的降落在了德国法兰克福
The X-Wing has landed permanently in Frankfurt, Germany.

1771
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,710
在哥本哈根 索伦仍在试图弄清
In Copenhagen, Soren is still trying to figure out

1772
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,630
无限的可能性
just how infinite the possibilities are.

1773
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:29,430
在捷克共和国斯蒂芬的好奇号火星车
And in the Czech Republic, Stephen's Curiosity Rover

1774
01:26:29,510 --> 01:26:31,390
终于正式进入了流水线
is finally rolling off the assembly line.

1775
01:26:33,350 --> 01:26:35,270
哇哦 好多漫步者 赞
Oh wow, that's a lot of rovers. Awesome.

1776
01:26:35,350 --> 01:26:37,140
包装设计真的很漂亮
That's really nice-looking box art.

1777
01:26:37,230 --> 01:26:39,770
嗯 是啊 这就是Cuusoo的优点
Oh, yeah, that's the great thing about Cuusoo sets,

1778
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:41,230
他们有最好的包装盒子
they have the best boxes.

1779
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:43,570
-哇哦 我在这  -找到你了
- Oh, there I am. It's me. - There you are.

1780
01:26:43,650 --> 01:26:45,110
"我希望这个模型
"It's my hope that this model

1781
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:46,700
能鼓励大家
encourages the public support

1782
01:26:46,780 --> 01:26:48,740
公众的支持是持续发展和
that is integral to the continued development

1783
01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:51,160
探索更广阔宇宙空间必不可缺的" 对
and exploration of outer space." Yeah.

1784
01:26:52,990 --> 01:26:55,500
我很开心 史蒂芬提到了空间
I'm glad Stephen mentioned space.

1785
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:57,830
我们的影片不就是从这里开始的吗
Didn't we start this film out there?

1786
01:26:57,920 --> 01:26:59,610
我保证我们会解释的
I promised we'd explain that,

1787
01:26:59,610 --> 01:27:02,170
现在快到这影片的结尾了
and seeing how this is the end of the movie,

1788
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:04,250
现在是时候了 为了那个故事
now is the time. For that story,

1789
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:06,340
我们去了加州的帕萨迪纳市
we go to Pasadena, California,

1790
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:10,300
美国国家航空航天局的喷气推进实验室 或者简称JPL
and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratories, or JPL for short.

1791
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:13,460
作为工程师和科学家
As engineers and scientists

1792
01:27:13,460 --> 01:27:16,430
他们通过开发宇宙飞船的想法和任务
are developing space craft ideas and missions

1793
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:19,350
去探索宇宙 了解太空
to go out and explore and learn about the universe,

1794
01:27:18,540 --> 01:27:22,880
美国航空航天局科学家

1795
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:22,440
我们有时候会用乐高来建立一种概念
we sometimes use LEGOs to kinda put together a concept

1796
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:24,150
然后看看是否合理
and see if it makes sense.

1797
01:27:24,230 --> 01:27:26,900
所以JPL有间房子叫怪诞想法
So there's a room here at JPL called the Left Field,

1798
01:27:26,990 --> 01:27:29,740
真的有这些玩具 有点像孩子的梦想
and it actually has these toys, sort of a kid's dream.

1799
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:32,490
有大盒的乐高 科学家和工程师
Has big boxes of LEGOs, and scientists and engineers

1800
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:34,620
聚在一起真正的构架一些东西
get together and actually construct something

1801
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:37,410
看起来有点像他们想要的宇宙飞船
that looks a little bit like the spacecraft they want.

1802
01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:46,260
搭载前往木星的朱诺一号运载火箭 阿特拉斯五号发射升空
Lift off of the Atlas 5 with Juno on a trek to Jupiter

1803
01:27:46,340 --> 01:27:49,050
朱诺计划是2011年8月启动的
The Juno project is a NASA mission

1804
01:27:49,130 --> 01:27:51,890
美国航天局使命 前往木星
that was launched in August of 2011 to go to Jupiter,

1805
01:27:51,970 --> 01:27:53,240
我们会用仪器
and we will use our

1806
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:56,310
来研究木星的构造
instruments to learn about Jupiter's formation

1807
01:27:56,390 --> 01:27:58,890
和其他太阳系行星的信息
and other solar systems around other stars.

1808
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:04,190
但是乐高不仅仅是设计程序的一部分
But the LEGO system was not just a part of the design process.

1809
01:28:04,270 --> 01:28:05,940
我们坐上飞船了
We're onboard!

1810
01:28:06,030 --> 01:28:09,030
美国航天局的工程师把我三个铝制朋友
NASA engineers have mounted three aluminum friends of mine

1811
01:28:09,110 --> 01:28:11,280
挂载在朱诺号船体上
to the hull of the Juno spacecraft.

1812
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:14,700
这三个小人分别以科学家伽利略
The three minifigures are modeled after Galileo the scientist,

1813
01:28:14,780 --> 01:28:17,950
朱庇特大神和朱诺女神为模板
Jupiter the god, and the goddess Juno.

1814
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:20,660
他们被安在宇宙飞船的主甲板上
They're attached to the main deck of the spacecraft.

1815
01:28:20,750 --> 01:28:24,540
他们是乐高公司用符合美航局规范的
They were made by the LEGO company, to NASA specifications,

1816
01:28:24,630 --> 01:28:27,750
特殊航天器级别铝制造的
of a special spacecraft-grade aluminum.

1817
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:30,880
有时候我会想
Sometimes I imagine,

1818
01:28:30,970 --> 01:28:33,550
他们会在航行中看到什么
what are they seeing in their voyage?

1819
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:38,020
他们可以看到美不胜收的景色
They're able to see this incredible view.

1820
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:40,810
事实上 他们会看到我们都梦寐以求的风光
In fact, they're seeing the view that we all want to see.

1821
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:45,230
这些乐高小人代表了我们
We're living vicariously through these LEGO minifigures.

1822
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:47,860
他们在很多方面代表了人类
They represent humanity in many ways.

1823
01:28:53,450 --> 01:28:56,370
宇宙中几乎所有事物都由别的东西构建而成
Almost everything in the universe is built from something else,

1824
01:28:56,450 --> 01:29:00,330
有些基本的组成单位 像是原子或分子
some fundamental building block like an atom or a molecule,

1825
01:29:00,410 --> 01:29:01,890
于我而言 乐高就代表了
and for me, LEGO represents

1826
01:29:01,890 --> 01:29:04,120
这样的一种基本单位
one of those fundamental building blocks.

1827
01:29:04,210 --> 01:29:07,340
看看我们利用这个简单的玩具做了多少东西
And look how many things we've built from this simple toy.

1828
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:26,520
-开拍  -开拍
- Action. - Action.

1829
01:29:30,230 --> 01:29:31,280
切
Cut!

1830
01:29:51,170 --> 01:29:53,130
放出猎犬
Release the hounds!

1831
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:55,050
额 那是个笑话吗
Now, was that-- was this a joke?

1832
01:29:55,130 --> 01:29:57,300
难道这应该搞笑吗 因为我不知道
Was this supposed to be funny? 'Cause I don't know if I...

1833
01:29:57,390 --> 01:29:59,300
我真的搞不懂 谁写的这个
I certainly don't get this. Who wrote this?

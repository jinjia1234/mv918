41
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:34,530
凭借凯撒的统领，新猿猴文明        初现。人类种族的幸存者只能奋力挣扎以求共存。
但因猿族叛徒科巴向人类展开复仇袭击，最终引发了战争。



46
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:59,350
人类向北面军事基地内集结的残余美国陆军发出紧急求救，
冷酷的特种部队上校和他的勇猛营士兵们受令去歼灭猿猴族。
传言指出凯撒在逃避追捕的近二年间，
身处于丛林中的秘密指挥基地组编战斗，随着        的肆虐…



59
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:14,930
猿猴

60
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:14,930
杀手

61
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:22,320
该闭眼了

62
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:22,320
也译作《君子红颜》(1951)：讲人类做实验让一只猩猩学习人类社会的道德观

63
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:22,320
猴崽子

64
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,350
濒危

00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:57,920
队长
Cap.

67
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,810
那是条战壕吗？
Is that a trench?

68
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,190
看起来里面好像还有更多的猴子
It looks like there's more of them inside.

69
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:52,040
回声 2-6 呼叫总部
Echo 2-6 to command.

70
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,500
上校 我们在树林北部发现三只猿类 一只持有武器
Colonel, we've got eyes on 3 kongs in the north woods. One of them is armed.

71
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,840
驴子刚发现了另一个战壕 它们的大本营可能就在附近
Our donkey just spotted another trench. Maybe the base is near.

72
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,990

你搞定那只有枪的
The one with the gun.

77

- 只要他击倒它 你们就马上把战壕轰了 - 遵命 长官
- As soon he guns him down, you guys take out the trench. - Yes, sir.Yes, sir.

78

00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,140
上校 你听得到吗 上校？

- 你是谁 - 我是普里彻 长官

00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,090
- 我不知道 - 你能看见什么吗？
- I don't know. - What do you see?

86
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,790
什么也看不见 我们损失惨重 小队长也阵亡了
I can't see anything, sir. We lost a lot of men and captain is dead, sir.

87
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:00,880

我觉得这只有我一个人了
I think it’s just me by myself now.

89
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,890
上校 我大概没有活路了
Colonel, I don‘t think I'm gonna make it, sir.

90
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,380
抱歉 长官 真的很抱歉

就是你 你就是凯撒
You are him. You're Caesar.

95
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,600
我们找你找得好苦
We've been searching for you for so long.

96
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,140
我们听说你有个隐蔽的指挥所 但我们就是找不到
We heard you had a hidden command base, but we could never find it.

97
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,610
我们当中有些人 觉得你可能已经死了
Some of us were starting to think that you might be dead,

98
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,310
但麦卡洛上校说你没死 而是藏在某处
but the Colonel McCullough said you were out here somewhere.

99
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,110
- 要杀就痛快点 - 闭嘴！
- Just kill us already. - Shut up, man!

100
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:07,130
怎么了？它们就是一群畜生 它会宰了我们的

101
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:19,400
这场战争不是我挑起的
I did not start this war.

102
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:23,240
罪魁祸首已经死了
The ape who did is dead.

103
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,470
他叫科巴
His name was Koba.

104
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,180
我已经处决了他
I killed him.

105
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:37,630
- 如今我只为保护猿族而战 - 是吗？
- Now I fight only to protect apes.  - Yeah?

106
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:43,820
那他呢？我们还有十多个那样的猿族
What about him? We got ten more just like him.

107
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:49,670
我认识他们 科巴的亲信
I know these apes. They followed Koba.

108
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,950
他们曾想杀了我
They tried to kill me.

109
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:56,440
他们害怕我的惩罚
They fear what I will do to them.

110
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,540
所以
So now

111
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,120
现在他们跟着你们
they serve you?

112
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,830
只是为了活命
just to survive.

113
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,590
我可不怕你
I no fear you!

114
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,460
你才应该害怕
You must fear!

115
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:19,830
你觉得你们还能在森林里藏多久？
How long you think woods can protect you?

116
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:23,430
人类能毁了你
Humans destroy you.

117
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:28,370
上校拥有至高无上的权力
Their Colonel has all power.

118
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:33,490
对这些人来说 他可不是个普通人
For them, he more than just human.

119
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,370
他就是神
He everything.

120
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:41,440
他说 先杀了凯撒
He say: "First Caesar die?

121
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:46,260
再让所有猴子给他陪葬
then all of you die."

122
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:56,360
温特 把这个叛徒带走
Winter! Take this traitor outside!

123
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,100
怎么处理这些人类？
What should we do with the humans?

124
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,280
你要放我们走？
You are letting us go?

125
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,160
告诉这位上校 你们见到我了
Tell your Colonel, you have seen me now.

126
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,490
替我传个话 只要他把森林留给我们
And I have a message for him. Leave us the woods?

127
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:32,200
一切杀戮就可以结束了
and the killing can stop.

128
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,820
你觉得他们会传话吗？
Do you think they will give him the message?

129
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,000
他们本身就传达了我的意思 毛里斯
They are the message, Maurice.

130
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,120
他会明白我们并不是什么野蛮动物
He will see we are not savages.

131
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:03,660
那个叛徒攻击了我！他跑了！
The traitor attacked me! He got away!

132
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,220
科巴真是阴魂不散
Koba still haunts us.

133
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:44,020
我之前没意识到 人类对他的所做所为 他有多么耿耿于怀
What I didn't see that he could not forgive what humans did to him.

134
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:48,080
没人知道他内心
No one could have known how much darkness...

135
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,120
有多阴暗
was living inside him.

- What is beyond those mountains, son? - Show them, Rocket.

147
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:55,310
一个沙漠！路途很遥远...
A desert! The journey is long...

148
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:58,180
所以人类不会找上门来的
But that is why humans will not find us.

149
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:01,190
我们必须今晚就离开！
We must leave tonight!

150
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,430
今晚？不可能
Tonight? That's impossible.

你儿子这段时间不在 凯撒...
Your son's been gone, Caesar...

153
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:25,270
他不知道我们的生活多艰难
He doesn't know how hard it's been.

154
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:30,540
我知道你很害怕

155

We all are...

156

但我们还是需要好好计划
But we are still planning...

157

对 我们要找到离开森林的安全路线
Yes. We must find a safe way out of woods.

158
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,420

我们会找到路线走出去的

00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,730
他之前吓坏了！我觉得他背叛了我们！

卫兵们觉得那些士兵在这里... 这里一直点着火

先让我把这些放下
Just gonna put this down.

208
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:10,700
他一个人在这里干什么？
What's he doing out here alone?

209
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:13,910
也许他是个逃兵？
Maybe he's a deserter?

210
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:28,050
四处看看
Look around.

211
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:32,940
能拿的东西都尽量带走

她自己一个人活不下去
She'll die out here alone.

215
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:00,000
我们不能带她走 毛里斯
We cannot take her, Maurice.

216

我明白... 但是我不能就这么扔下她

218
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:13,950
只有死了的金刚

219
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:13,950
才是好金刚

220
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:21,510
你发现上校了吗？
Did you find the Colonel?

221
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:24,270
没有
No.

222

00:35:55,090 --> 00:36:00,580
今天早上离开的 带走了很多人
He left this morning, took many men with him.

226
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:04,150
因为有更多的士兵要从北方过来
More soldiers are coming down from the North.

227
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:09,350
上校要去边境地带和他们汇合
The Colonel is going to meet them at the border.

228
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,830
什么边境？为什么？

230

但是我们这些剩下的人 明天也要走
But the rest of us are going tomorrow.

231
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:27,400
驴子们认为北方来的那些士兵
Donkeys think the soldiers from the North

232
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:31,620
是来援助军队 彻底铲除掉猿族

233
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:34,620
那一天 山上那场战斗结束以后
That day, after the battle on the hill,

234

我们抓到的那个驴子答应我 如果我告诉他们你们藏在哪里
the donkey we caught promised me the Colonel would spare my life

235
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:43,770
上校就会饶我一命
if I told them where you were hiding.

236
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:47,860
原谅我！
Forgive me!

237
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,430
我儿子...

238
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:59,830
我妻子...

00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:23,760
跟着他们找到上校
Follow them to the Colonel.

243
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:58,560
科巴？
Koba?

244
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:05,690
猿族不应该杀害猿族
Ape not kill ape.

245
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:17,950
士兵们动身了！
The soldiers are leaving!

246
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,590
他们停下了
They stopped.

247
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:13,400
他们在朝什么开火？
What are they shooting at?

248

我不知道
I don't know.

249
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:42,090
为什么他们要杀了你？
Why did they shoot you?

250
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:03,990
和她一样！

他的伤口都是致命的

00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:26,020
卢卡

254
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:47,800

我不认识他 他不是我们的人

这里只有你一个吗？

00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:06,580
听上去就像科巴
you sound like Koba.

367
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:14,950
带你们来是个错误的决定
It was a mistake bringing you all.

368
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:17,380
这是我一个人的战斗
This is my fight.

369
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:20,090
我会独自完成的
I will finish this alone.

370
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:23,850
你们走吧 快
Go. Now.

371
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:26,560
去加入大部队
Join the others.

372
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:56,780
怎么回事？
What happened?

373
01:00:57,790 --> 01:01:01,740
他们突然出现
They came out of nowhere...

374
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:04,460
袭击了我们
Attacked us.

375
01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:07,560
我们以为他们会将我们全部杀掉
We thought they would kill us all...

376
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:11,150
但是上校阻止了他们
But the Colonel stopped them!

377
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,560
他的眼神里流露着疯狂
There was madness in his eyes!

378
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:19,390
他说要在我们死之前好好利用我们
He said they would use us, before we died!

379
01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:22,880
然后他们就把我们都带到这儿来了
And they brought us all here!

380
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:26,380
利用你们？
Use you?

381
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:30,530
他们逼迫我们干活
They've been forcing us to work!

382
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:32,550
什么…
What...

383
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:35,260
让你们干什么样的活？
What kind of work?

384
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:41,630
等等 我的小儿子 他怎么样了
Wait. My little son is here.

385
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:54,090
格兰特
Grant...

386
01:01:54,090 --> 01:01:57,240
李

387
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:01,830
惠林顿

388
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:05,460
和拿破仑

389
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:09,810
卡斯特
Custer

390
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:13,370
还有卧牛
and Sitting Bull...

391
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:18,750
你可能没看过什么书
You’re probably not much of a reader,

392
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:23,090
但这是一个伟大的时刻
but this is a big moment.

393
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:26,090
你躲哪儿去了？
Where were you?

394
01:02:26,090 --> 01:02:30,650
我们完全是偶遇到了你的族群 真幸运
We came upon your herd. We got lucky.

395
01:02:30,650 --> 01:02:34,530
我很惊讶 你居然没跟他们在一起
I was surprised you weren’t with them.

396
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:49,320
但愿你不会后悔放了他
I hope you don’t come to regret sparing his life.

397
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,310
他是个优秀的射手
He's quite a good shot.

398
01:02:57,660 --> 01:03:01,660
你最终还是来救你的族人了吗？
Have you finally come to save your apes?

399
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:04,260
我是来找你的
I came for you.

400
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:06,970
找我？
For me?

401
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,390
那天晚上我杀的是谁？
Who did I kill that night?

402
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:13,510
我的妻子
My wife.

403
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:17,240
还有我的儿子
My son.

404
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:30,020
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

405
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:33,000
我本来是想杀你的
I was there for you.

406
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:45,680
我的天哪
God.

407
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:48,430
看看你的眼睛
Look at your eyes.

408
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:51,360
简直跟人类的眼睛一模一样
Almost human.

409
01:03:54,470 --> 01:04:00,170
- 你是怎么找到这儿的 - 我收到消息 你会来这儿
- How did you know I was here?  - I was told you were coming.

410
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:03,570
北方的大部队
That more soldiers from the north...

411
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:07,180
- 会来这儿和你汇合 - 和我汇合？
- would be joining you here.  - Joining me?

412
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:10,020
为了把我们猿类
To finish us off.

413
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:13,330
赶尽杀绝
For good.

414
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:17,530
谁告诉你的？
Who told you that?

415
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:28,210
好吧
Okay.

416
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:31,890
我们走
Let's go.

417
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:11,890
爸爸！
Father!

418
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:15,790
爸爸！

420
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:44,960
原谅他们吧 我们经历太多了
Forgive them. We've been through much.

421
01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:54,240
爸爸！
Father!

422
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:57,930
我都做了什么？
What have I done?

423
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:38,320
全体 立定！
Battalion, halt!

424
01:07:42,910 --> 01:07:46,010
- 鲜血！ - 滋养青草！
- Blood!  - Makes the grass grow!

425
01:07:46,010 --> 01:07:48,490
- 我们！  - 可以献出鲜血！
- We!  - Make the blood flow!

426
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:52,250
- 我们既是开始！ - 也是终结！
- We are the beginning!  - And the end!

自从我们来了这儿 还没得到水和食物…
We haven't had food or water since we got here...

436
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:46,270
他们为什么要建这堵墙？
Why do they need a wall?

437
01:10:21,310 --> 01:10:23,590
驴子！
Donkey!

438
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:26,340
- 教训他 – 好的
- Get him! - Okay, okay.

01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:29,050
好的
Okay.

440

别再打了！
Leave him!

441
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:43,670
- 让他们回去继续工作 – 我们需要食物和水

442
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:51,200
- 告诉他们 – 给他们食物和水

把他绑起来 驴子
String him up, donkey.

01:14:58,190 --> 01:15:01,270
坏地方
Bad place.

450
01:15:02,490 --> 01:15:05,330
很坏 很坏的地方
Bad, bad place.

451
01:15:07,350 --> 01:15:10,060
你看到了什么
What you see?

452
01:15:15,230 --> 01:15:18,230
- 一定要救他们 – 怎么救？
- Must save them! - But how?

453
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:22,070
动动脑子 凯撒他会怎么做？

啊！
No!

455
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:29,750
怎么这么小？
Why so small?

456
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:04,220
上校承诺了你什么？
What did the Colonel promised you?

457
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:08,380
你真以为他会放过你吗
You really think he let you live?

458
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:11,090
在我们都死了之后？
After we are gone?

459
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:14,430
你让他们叫你驴子
You let them call you donkey.

460
01:16:14,430 --> 01:16:17,220
可你是猿类
You are ape.

461
01:16:25,890 --> 01:16:29,500
上校要见你
Colonel wants see you.

462

历史

463
01:16:53,290 --> 01:16:55,070
再敢妨碍他们干活
Interfere with the work again,

464
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:57,820
我就把他们一个个全都杀掉
I will begin slaughtering the apes, one by one.

465
01:16:57,820 --> 01:17:00,060
听懂了吗？我需要那堵墙
Understand? I need that wall.

466
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:02,320
他们需要食物和水
Apes need food and water.

467
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:07,420
当任务完成后 我自然会给他们食物和水
They'll get food and water when they finish their work.

468
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:12,010
给他们食物和水
Give apes food and water.

469
01:17:12,010 --> 01:17:16,740
- 否则任务没法完成 – 你太感情用事了
- Or they cannot finish it. - You know, you're very emotional.

470
01:17:18,450 --> 01:17:23,280
你有什么资本跟我讨价还价？
What makes you think you’re in a position to make demands?

471
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:31,060
- 好了 我们走 – 大部队快到了
- Okay, let's go. - The soldiers who are coming here,

472
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:35,330
他们不是来和你汇合的 对吧？
they are not coming to join you, are they?

473
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:41,560
我看到外面那些士兵 在墙上准备作战
I saw men outside, on the wall, preparing for battle.

474
01:17:43,170 --> 01:17:47,980
他们告诉我你很聪明 不过想不到这么聪明
They told me you're smart, but that's impressive.

475
01:17:47,980 --> 01:17:51,730
对 他们不是来汇合的
No, they won't be joining me.

476
01:17:51,730 --> 01:17:53,440
他们是你的敌人吗？
They are against you?

477
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:56,590
他们害怕我
They fear me.

478
01:17:56,590 --> 01:18:00,750
为什么 因为你连自己人也杀吗？
Why? Because you kill your own men?

479
01:18:01,190 --> 01:18:03,500
我们发现了尸体
We found bodies.

480
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:07,890
那几个人很不对劲
Something wrong with these men.

481
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:13,940
天哪 你真是让我大开眼界
Jesus Christ, you are impressive.

482
01:18:15,030 --> 01:18:19,260
据你所知 你肯定觉得我不是好人
You paint quite a picture. What you must think of me.

483
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:23,060
我觉得你没有怜悯之心
I think you have no mercy.

484
01:18:40,730 --> 01:18:43,440
你可是来杀我的
You came here to kill me.

485
01:18:44,070 --> 01:18:46,050
难道你会对我有怜悯之心吗？
Were you going to show me mercy?

486
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:50,820
我放了你的人 这就是我的怜悯之心
I showed you mercy when I spared your men.

487
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:55,940
我提出了和平共处 可你却杀了我的家人
I offered you peace and you killed my family.

488
01:19:10,230 --> 01:19:12,570
怜悯
Mercy.

489
01:19:12,580 --> 01:19:16,830
你知道你的怜悯会让我们陷入怎样的境地吗？
Do you have any idea what your mercy would do to us?

490
01:19:19,890 --> 01:19:22,850
你们比我们强壮
You’re much stronger than we are.

491
01:19:23,070 --> 01:19:25,310
还那么聪明
You're smart as hell.

492
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:28,870
不管你怎么说 你们终将取代我们
No matter what you say, you’d eventually replace us.

493
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:30,710
这是自然的法则
That’s the law of Nature.

494
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:32,980
讽刺的是 是我们创造了你们
The irony is, we created you.

495
01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:36,110
我们总是试着违背自然 征服自然
We tried to defy Nature, bend it to our will.

496
01:19:36,110 --> 01:19:41,420
于是大自然开始惩罚我们的自以为是
And Nature’s been punishing us for our arrogance ever since.

497
01:19:43,650 --> 01:19:47,130
十个月前 我派出了侦查小组去寻找你们的基地
Ten months ago, I sent out recon units to look for your base.

498
01:19:47,130 --> 01:19:50,770
我的儿子就是这个小组的一员
My own son was a soldier with one of the units.

499
01:19:50,770 --> 01:19:53,060
有一天他突然不能说话了
One day he suddenly stopped speaking.

500
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:55,700
他变得原始化 像动物一样
He became primitive, like an animal.

501
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:57,040
他们告诉我
They contacted me,

502
01:19:57,070 --> 01:20:00,200
说他们觉得我儿子疯了
said that they thought he’d lost his mind,

503
01:20:00,310 --> 01:20:03,330
因为承受不住战争的压力
that the war was too much for him.

504
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:07,520
后来负责照顾他的那个人也不会说话了
Then the man who cared for him stopped speaking too.

505
01:20:07,870 --> 01:20:12,540
在小队的医务兵还能说话的时候 他提出了一个理论
Their medic had a theory, before he stopped speaking,

506
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:15,210
即使是幸存者身上也同样携带着
that the virus that almost wiped us out,

507
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:19,590
那让人类濒临灭绝的可怕病毒
the virus that every human survivor still carries,

508
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:21,900
病毒突变了
had suddenly changed.

509
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:24,610
变异了
Mutated.

510
01:20:24,980 --> 01:20:30,420
如果它转播开来 人类将会彻底灭亡
And if it spread, it would destroy humanity for good this time.

511
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:37,350
不是杀死我们 而是会夺走我们之所以成为人类的核心
Not by killing us, but by robbing us of the things that make us human.

512
01:20:37,350 --> 01:20:40,130
我们的语言 我们的高等思想
Our speech, our higher thinking.

513
01:20:40,130 --> 01:20:44,980
它会把我们变成野兽 而你却在这儿跟我谈怜悯？
It would turn us into beasts. You talk about mercy?

514
01:20:46,810 --> 01:20:49,520
换作你你会怎么做？
What would you have done?

515
01:20:51,630 --> 01:20:54,520
当时有那么一刻我非常清醒
It was a moment of clarity for me.

516
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:58,750
我意识到我必须牺牲自己唯一的儿子
I realized that I would have to sacrifice my only son,

517
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:02,710
这样人类才能得以保全
so that humanity could be saved.

518
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:10,300
我握着那把枪很久很久
I held that gun in my hand for a long time...

519
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:19,050
我把它对着我唯一的孩子
And I pointed it at my only child.

520
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:26,480
他看着我 眼神里全是信任
He looked at me with trust in his eyes.

521
01:21:28,210 --> 01:21:31,390
即使在他原始的眼神中
Even in his primitive gaze,

522
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:38,290
我也感受到了他的…
I felt his...

523
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:41,050
爱
love.

524
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:49,840
我扣动了扳机
I pulled the trigger.

525
01:21:50,850 --> 01:21:56,950
我感觉被净化了 这使我的目标更加明确
It purified me. It made my purpose clear.

526
01:21:58,350 --> 01:22:02,540
我下令杀掉其他所有被感染的人
I gave orders to kill the others infected, all of them.

527
01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:07,420
烧掉他们任何能够传播病毒的东西
Burn their belongings, anything that might spread contamination.

528
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:09,950
有些手下质疑我的判断
Some of the men questioned my judgment.

529
01:22:09,950 --> 01:22:13,070
我是在让他们去做和我一样的选择
I was asking them to do what I had done,

530
01:22:13,070 --> 01:22:19,000
牺牲他们的朋友 家人
to sacrifice their friends, their family.

531
01:22:20,710 --> 01:22:23,940
当然 他们拒绝了
Of course, they refused.

532
01:22:25,970 --> 01:22:28,680
所以我把他们也杀了
I had them killed too.

533
01:22:29,850 --> 01:22:35,070
其他带着孩子的偷偷逃进了树林里
Others with children deserted into the woods.

534
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:39,570
有一个懦夫 跑到了北方我的上级那里
One of those cowards fled to my superiors up north.

535
01:22:39,570 --> 01:22:41,440
他们试图说服我
They tried to convince me

536
01:22:41,470 --> 01:22:44,910
让我相信这场瘟疫可以通过医疗手段来解决
that this plague could be dealt with medically.

537
01:22:44,910 --> 01:22:51,600
我意识到 在经历了这么多之后他们还是什么都没学到
That’s when I realized that they had learned nothing from our past.

538
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:55,830
你把他们也杀了？
You killed them too?

539
01:22:57,100 --> 01:22:59,810
我是怎么做的来着 普里彻？
What did I do, Preacher?

540
01:23:00,250 --> 01:23:02,890
你砍下了他们的脑袋 长官
You severed their heads, sir.

541
01:23:02,890 --> 01:23:05,250
除了被我放走的那一个
Except for the one I spared

542
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:08,360
我让他回去替我捎个口信
so he could return and deliver a message.

543
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:11,170
如果他们想要卸下我的指挥权
If they wanted to relieve me of my command,

544
01:23:11,170 --> 01:23:15,770
就得来这里找我 亲自动手
they’d have to meet me here, and do it themselves.

545
01:23:15,770 --> 01:23:18,580
这里曾经是个军械库
This used to be a weapons depot.

546
01:23:18,630 --> 01:23:23,410
在猿流感爆发初期 他们把这里改造成了一个集中营
They turned it into a relocation camp when the crisis was just beginning.

547
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:28,290
但是武器还在这里 就在山里面
But the weapons are all still here, inside the mountain.

548
01:23:28,290 --> 01:23:31,790
他们会派多少人来？
How many men will be coming?

549
01:23:31,790 --> 01:23:33,500
可能会倾巢出动
Probably all of them.

550
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:35,560
但别想太多
But don’t get any ideas,

551
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:39,010
除了我 他们最怕的就是你们猿类了
the only thing they fear more than me is you apes.

552
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:50,210
这是一场圣战
This is a holy war.

553
01:23:51,090 --> 01:23:55,590
所有人类历史都指向这一时刻
All of human history has led to this moment.

554
01:23:55,590 --> 01:24:00,590
如果我们输了 我们将成为最后的人类
If we lose, we’II be the last of our kind.

555
01:24:00,850 --> 01:24:07,620
我们的地球会成为你们的猩球 而我们也会成为你们的牲口
It will be a planet of apes, and we’II become your cattle.

556
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:11,320
看看你
Look at you.

557
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:14,150
你觉得我疯了 对吧？
You think I am sick, don't you?

558
01:24:22,220 --> 01:24:25,190
我其实并不想杀你儿子
I didn’t mean to kill your son.

559
01:24:26,810 --> 01:24:31,440
但如果他注定会继承你的王位
But if his destiny was to inherit your unholy kingdom...

560
01:24:32,470 --> 01:24:35,180
那我很欣慰我杀了他
I am glad I did.

561
01:24:36,670 --> 01:24:39,380
回来！
Get back!

562
01:24:47,170 --> 01:24:49,880
这么感情用事！
So emotional!

563
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:59,390
我知道你内心非常纠结
I see how conflicted you are.

564
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:03,100
你搞不清楚自己的目标
You are confused in your purpose.

565
01:25:03,230 --> 01:25:08,450
你对我的所作所为感到愤怒 但这就是残酷的战争
You’re angry at me for something I did that was an act of war.

566
01:25:08,630 --> 01:25:13,120
而现在你已经对此注入了太多的私人恩怨
But you’re taking this all much far too personally.

567
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:19,880
你好好想想 如果你杀了我
What do you think my men would have done to your apes,

568
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:22,670
我的人会怎么处置你的同类？
if you had killed me?

569
01:25:23,150 --> 01:25:25,910
还是说杀了我对你来说更重要？
Or is killing me more important?

570
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:42,520
到处都是士兵 我们要怎么进去？
Soldiers everywhere! How will we get in?

571
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:47,660
得想办法进去 必须得进去！
Must get in somehow... Must get in!

572
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:51,080
进去？要进去？
In? In?

573
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:52,980
不行！
No!

574
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:56,130
不能进去！不能！
No go in! No!

575
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:06,630

Friends! Friends! No! No go in!

576
01:26:06,630 --> 01:26:09,340
不能进去！
No go in!

577
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:14,480

谢谢 谢谢 朋友
Thank you. Thank you, friend.

579
01:27:06,370 --> 01:27:09,780
你救了我们的命！
You save our lives!

580
01:27:46,230 --> 01:27:53,930
此路

581
01:27:46,230 --> 01:27:53,930
可逃出生天

582
01:27:49,660 --> 01:27:55,650
患病的人类 肯定就是从这里逃走的
Sick humans must have escaped down here!

583
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:05,750
不 不！别爬！
No, no! No, no climb! No!

584
01:28:18,530 --> 01:28:21,990
什么？你看到了什么？
What? What you see?

585
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:30,910
我们在哪里
Wonder where we are.

586
01:28:29,970 --> 01:28:32,970
猿灾

587
01:28:29,970 --> 01:28:32,970
泛滥

588
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:57,750
不！朋友
No! Friend...

589
01:29:01,060 --> 01:29:05,410
不！
No!

590
01:29:05,410 --> 01:29:07,610
不！不！

不！回来 回来！
No! Come, come!

592

回来！回来 回来
Come! Come, come.

593
01:29:17,010 --> 01:29:18,990
不！回来！
No! Come!

594
01:29:18,990 --> 01:29:21,700
回来！回来！
Come! Come, come!

595
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:55,790
科巴...
Koba...

596
01:30:00,090 --> 01:30:02,320
睡吧
Sleep.

597
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:05,570
你救不了他们的
You cannot save them.

598
01:30:06,620 --> 01:30:10,890
猿类都将死在这里
Apes all die here.

599
01:30:13,230 --> 01:30:15,960
- 不会的！- 会的
- No! - Yes.

600
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:20,560
跟我来...
Join me...

601
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:39,990
如果明早他还活着
If he's still alive in the morning...

602
01:30:44,630 --> 01:30:48,320
就让他回去和其他猿类一起干活
He goes back to work as everyone else.

603
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:50,870
不然就杀了他
Or you shoot him.

604
01:30:50,870 --> 01:30:54,860

躲起来 快点
Hide. Quick.

608
01:34:38,580 --> 01:34:41,610
那些人类会杀了她的！
Humans will kill her!

609
01:34:42,210 --> 01:34:45,430
我知道怎么做 你们快走！
I know what to do! Go!

610
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:20,310
还有其他猿类在这吗？
Are there others out there?

611
01:36:27,220 --> 01:36:29,930
去搜查下附近
Sweep the area.

612
01:36:29,980 --> 01:36:32,690
把他押到围栏里去
Put him in the pen.

613
01:37:14,330 --> 01:37:18,900
好点了吗？
Feeling better?

614

那就好 那我们可以计划下逃跑的事了
Good. Then we can talk about escape.

615

猩猩团结力量大！

616
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:43,860
- 我们既是开始！ - 亦是终结！
- We are the beginning! - And the end!

617
01:38:06,860 --> 01:38:09,570
还活着呢
Still alive.

618
01:38:40,050 --> 01:38:42,920
派他去采石场 就他一个
Send him to the quarry. Alone.

619
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:48,220
等等
Hold on.

620
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:08,430
这是什么？
What is this?

621
01:39:11,630 --> 01:39:14,340
这东西怎么到这的？
How did this get in there?

622
01:39:16,520 --> 01:39:19,230
带他去干活
Get him to work.

623
01:39:31,350 --> 01:39:34,060
37
Thirty-seven.

624
01:39:43,690 --> 01:39:46,400
55
Fifty-five.

625
01:39:47,180 --> 01:39:49,550
走37步到大部队的笼子
Thirty-seven steps to the adult cage.

626
01:39:49,550 --> 01:39:52,670
55步到孩子们的
Fifty-five to the children.

627
01:40:26,430 --> 01:40:27,970
驴子

628
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:37,690
你明知道 等到墙建好了 上校就会杀了所有猿类
You know, Colonel shoot apes when wall is done.

629
01:40:40,330 --> 01:40:44,440
这墙是疯狂之举
This wall is madness.

630
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:47,330
根本救不了他
It won't save him.

631
01:40:47,930 --> 01:40:50,370
就像它也救不了你一样
Anymore than it will save you.

632
01:40:50,370 --> 01:40:53,170
我自己会救我自己
I save myself.

633
01:40:53,170 --> 01:40:59,320
你自己还剩什么值得去救的？
Is there anything left of you to save?

634
01:41:20,540 --> 01:41:23,250
起来
Up!

635
01:41:39,130 --> 01:41:41,840
大伙都回笼子里了吗？
Apes going back to the cage?

636

你真勇敢
You are very brave.

猿类？
Ape?

640
01:42:02,780 --> 01:42:06,500
我 是猿类吗？
Me? Ape?

641
01:42:13,420 --> 01:42:16,130
你是…
You are...

642

643
01:42:31,260 --> 01:42:33,970

34, 35, 36, 37! 30! 37!

648
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:15,930
我数好了
I do.

649
01:43:17,090 --> 01:43:19,800
那现在怎么办？
What now?

650
01:43:27,290 --> 01:43:30,000
什么？
What?

651
01:43:35,030 --> 01:43:39,110
不！
No!

652
01:43:39,110 --> 01:43:43,410
不 不  不 不！
No, no! No, no!

653
01:43:47,150 --> 01:43:49,860
好吧
Okay.

654
01:44:54,180 --> 01:44:57,830
这就是我跟你们说的那个同类！
This is the ape I told you about!

655
01:44:58,740 --> 01:45:01,630
谢谢你
Thank you.

656
01:45:17,850 --> 01:45:20,590
坏猿
Bad Ape.

657
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:24,210
我是坏猿
Bad Ape.

658
01:45:25,010 --> 01:45:27,720
坏...坏猿
Bad... Bad Ape.

659
01:45:39,340 --> 01:45:42,190
怎么了？
What's wrong?

660
01:46:00,870 --> 01:46:04,270
我们不能再挖了 要不然整个隧道都会被淹了的！
We can't keep digging! It will flood the whole tunnel!

661
01:46:04,270 --> 01:46:08,210
可是不继续的话 我们就够不到孩子们了啊！
If we don't, we can't reach the children!

662
01:46:12,970 --> 01:46:15,470
m 10 0 l 209.625 0 l 219.5 7.375 l 209.625 14.75 l 10 14.75 l 0 7.375 l 10 0

663
01:46:13,270 --> 01:46:15,770
把恐惧留给

664
01:46:13,270 --> 01:46:15,770
自己

665
01:46:13,270 --> 01:46:15,770
和他人

666
01:46:13,270 --> 01:46:15,770
分享勇气

667
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:28,680
我们必须继续在这下面找路子...
We must keep looking down there...

668
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:30,920
再想想其他办法去孩子们那里
Find another way to reach the children.

669
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:35,150
我们现在必须马上离开 更多士兵就要来了！
We must leave now! More soldiers are coming!

670
01:46:35,150 --> 01:46:39,970
人类要自相残杀 也会殃及我们的
Humans will destroy each other! And us with them!

671
01:46:43,710 --> 01:46:46,420
那现在只能在地面上救孩子们出来了
We’II have to get the children out above ground.

672
01:46:46,460 --> 01:46:49,170
怎么救？
How?

673
01:47:24,290 --> 01:47:27,000
你们这些畜生！
You animals!

674
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:51,020
谁干的？
Who did that?

675
01:47:54,570 --> 01:47:57,280
到底是谁？
Who was it?

676
01:48:03,670 --> 01:48:06,380
是你吗？
Was it you?

677
01:49:57,960 --> 01:50:01,340
我爱你 儿子
I love you, son.

678
01:51:09,990 --> 01:51:12,700
走 快走
Go, go.

679

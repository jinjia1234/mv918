人类种族的幸存者只能奋力挣扎以求共存。
但因猿族叛徒高巴向人类展开复仇袭击，最终引发了战争。

00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,450
开火！

士兵你在何处？ 我需要你的位置

什么也看不清，我们损失惨重，队长亦已阵亡！长官
I can't see anything, sir. We lost a lot of men and captain is dead!  Sir

我认为现在只剩下我一个了

就是你了，你是凯撒

00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,170
我们找你已有段时间了
We've been searching for you for so long.

58
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:53,570
我们听闻你拥有一个秘密的指挥基地，但我们从来没有找到它
We heard you had a hidden command base, but we could never find it.

59
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,410
我们中某些人认为你可能已经死亡

00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,690
但麦卡洛上校说 你就藏在这里某处

63
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:16,020
我没有挑起这场战争
I did not start this war.

64
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,850
引发战争的猿猴…已死了
The Ape who did... is dead.

65
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,100
他的名字叫高巴
His name was Koba.

66
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,800
我杀了他

67
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:34,240
- 现在，我只为保护猿猴们而战斗     - 是吗？
- Now, I'm fight only to protect the Apes.     - Yeah?

68
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:40,440
那他如何？ 我们还有十个以上像他那样
What about him? We got ten more like him.

69
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,980
我认识这些猿猴们，他们追随高巴

70
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,790
他们尝试杀了我
They tried to kill me.

71
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:54,030
他们害怕我将会怎样对待他们
They fear what I would do to them.

72
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,760
所以现在…
So now...

73
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,900
他们顺从你…
They serve you...

74
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,440
只是为了活命
Just to survive.

75
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,300
我并不怕你！
I don't fear you!

76
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,070
你定是恐惧了！
You must fear!

77
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:17,120
你认为丛林还能保护你多久？
How long you think woods can protect you?

78
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,750
人类要灭掉你
Humans destroy you.

79
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:24,680
他们的上校拥有所有的力量
Their Colonel has all power.

80
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,810
对他们来说，他不仅仅是个人类
For them, he is more that just human.

81
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,240
他掌控一切
He's everything.

82
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,050
他说：当凯撒一死
He says, "First Caesar die...

83
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,430
你们全体也命不久矣
then all of you die."

84
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,220
温达！ 带这叛徒出去！
Winter! Take this traitor outside!

85
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:02,170
这些人类我们怎样处置？
What should we do with the humans?

86
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,900
你放我们走吗？
You let us go?

87
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,540
告诉你们的上校，你们见过我了
Tell your Colonel, You have seen me now.

88
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,230
并且我要给他一个讯息...
And I have a message for him...

89
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:29,070
「让我们穿越丛林，杀戮将可终止」
"Leave us passed the woods and the killing can stop."

90
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,300
你认为他们会将讯息传递给他吗？
Do you think they will give him the message?

91
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,070
他们本身就是个口讯，莫利斯
They are the message, Morris.

92
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,180
他会明白到我们并非野蛮人
He will see we are not savages.

93
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:59,720
那叛徒袭击了我！ 他逃走了！
The traitor attacked me! He got away!

94
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,390
高巴仍继续缠扰着我们
Koba still haunts us.

95
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:40,190
我看不见他会原谅人类对他作出的恶行
I did not seen that he could not forgive what humans did to him.

96
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:45,230
没人会知道将有何种情度的黑暗
No one could have known how much darkness...

97
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:48,280
在他心中存在着
...was living inside him.

98
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,860
父亲！

99
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,060

我们可以重新开始… 一个新家园

那些山脉背后有什么东西，儿子？

112
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,370
给他们看，洛基
Show them, Rocket.

113
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,350
一个沙漠！
A desert!

114
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,060
路途遥远
The journey is long...

115
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,850
但就因为这样，人类才找不到我们
But that is why humans will not find us.

116
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,830
我们需要今晚起程！
We must leave tonight!

117
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,570
今晚？ 这不可能吧！
Tonight? That's impossible!

118
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,300
我们还能等多久，力克？
How long can we wait, Lake?

119
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,360
士兵越来越近了！
Soldiers getting closer!

温达

121
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:17,090
你的儿子一早已离开了，凯撒
Your son's been gone, Caesar.

122
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,430
他根本不知道这里是何等艰苦
He doesn't know how hard it's been.

123
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,030
我知你受惊了
I know you are scared.

124
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,420
我们全体皆是

但我们仍在计划着…

127
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,880
你们两人能力有限

00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,100
但我们人手众多
But we are many.

129
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:02,330
我们将会找出离开这里的方法
We'll find a way out of here.

猿猴们团结就会强大

00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,950
留在这儿，儿子

保护好你的母亲及兄弟！
Protect your mother and brother!

133
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,270
凯撒！ 有何不妥？！
Caesar! What's wrong?!

134
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,060
有多少猿猴在巡逻？
How many on patrol?

135
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:12,880
五个，或六个
Five? Six?

136

召集他们！

路加，与华格道同去

单位呼叫指挥，上校请答话

139
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,500
洛基，发生什么事？
Rocket? What happening?

140
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,300
我听到他的通话！ 上校已到这里了！
I heard him talking! The Colonel is here!

141
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,160
我高声宣布，目标已达成。

142
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:37,060
我高声宣布，目标已达成。 重复，金刚已死

143
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:40,080
走吧！ 我将由这里往上撤
Let's go. I'll get up from here.

144
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,710
凯撒
Caesar

145
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,850
我们找不到温达！
We can not find Winter!

146
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:56,400
他受惊了！ 我怀疑他已背叛了我们！
He was Scared! I think he betrayed us!

147
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:04,010
你找到了科尼利亚斯吗？
Have you found Cornelius yet?

148
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,220
我们仍在找
We're still searching.

149
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,230
那去找凯撒的小儿子吧
Let's go look for Caesar's little son.

150
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,830
过来，科尼利亚斯
Come, Cornelius.

00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:01,480
你现在安全了

照护他的弟弟，直到我回来
Look after his brother, until I return.

00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,300
你不与我们一起到新家园去吗？

156
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,340
不了

00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:44,190
跟力克走
Go with Lake.

158
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,300
凯撒！
Caesar!

159
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,520
你不跟他们一起走吗？！
You're not going after them?!

160
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,570
不是他们，要找“他”

161
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:12,340
凯撒，你是我们的领袖！

162
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,470
我们没有你不能离开！
We can't leave without you!

163
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,010
你必定要

164

那些士兵很快便会回来

165
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,960
父亲！
Father!

166
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:27,210
当我找到他后，士兵们将会追捕我
When I find him, the soldiers will come after me.

167
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:31,670
让我给你们一个好机会，逃出丛林
Let me give you the best chance to get out of the woods.

168
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,210
他要往那里去？！
Where is he going?!

169
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:44,440
凯撒！ 凯撒！
Caesar! Caesar!

170
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:35,800
那些军营是经常迁移的
The soldiers' camp is always moving.

171
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,160
我的护卫知道军营在哪里
My guards think they know where it is

172
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,700
让我引领你
Let me take you

173
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,400
你需要我来当你的后援！
You need me to back you up!

174
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,700
不用！
No!

175
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:46,900
拜托
Please.

176
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,660
我知道失去了儿子的滋味
I know what it's like to lose a son

177
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:57,300
我或许没能救他回来
I may not make him back.

178
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,900
所以为什么我要跟着来
That's why I'm coming

179
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:06,370
是为了确保你能达成
To make sure you do.

180
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,400
护卫认为士兵就在这里
Guards think soldiers here.

181
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,960
总是有烟火吹生
Always fires burning.

182
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:03,100
这里没有人
No one here.

183
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,600
搜索这片区域
Search the area.

184
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,680
我只想将这东西放下
I'll just gonna put this down.

185
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,250
他独个儿在这里干什么？
What's he doing out here alone?

186
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,680
可能他是一名逃兵
Maybe he's a deserter?

187
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,030
四处搜搜
Look around

188
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,920
要什么就拿走吧
Take what you can.

189
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:24,800
她出了点问题
Something wrong with her.

190

我不认为她可以正常说话

00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,940
来吧
Come

192
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,990
她独自留下来会死的
She'll die out here alone.

193
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,180
我们不能携她同行，莫利斯
We can not take her, Morris.

194
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,200
我明白...
I understand...

195
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,900
但我不能留下她
But I cannot leave her.

196
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,030
你找到上校没有？
Did you find the Colonel?

197
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,500
没找到
No.

198
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,250
温达

199
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,050
上校在那里？
Where's the Colonel?

200
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,500
他走了
He's gone.

201
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:51,150
已走了？
Gone?

202
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,350
他早上走了

203
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:57,350
带着大伙人随他同行
...took many men with him

204
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:00,930
还有更多士兵正由北面下来
More soldiers are coming down from the North.

205
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,770
上校将与他们会合
The Colonel will meet with them...

206
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,070
在边境处
at the border.

207
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,560
在那里干什么？  为何事？
What's do here? Why?

208
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,850
我不知
I do not know.

209

但余下的我们将会明早起程
But the rest of us are going tomorrow.

210
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:24,350
猩猩们认为北面的士兵
The donkeys think the soldiers from the North...

211
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:28,650
是为了协助完成歼灭整个猿猴族而来
...are coming to help finish off the apes for good.

212
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,450
在山上战斗的哪天
That day, after the battle on the hill...

213
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:36,340
被活捉的猩猩获许诺，上校会留我们一命...
The donkey we caught promised is that the Colonel will spare my life...

214
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:40,200
如果我肯告诉他们，你的藏身地点。
if I told them where you were hiding.

215
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,640
原谅我！
Forgive me!

216
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:51,290
我的儿子
My son,

217
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:56,850
我的妻子
My wife,

218
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,850
都死了

219
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,600
现在我们怎办？
Now what do we do?

220
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,830
等待直至士兵离开
Wait till the soldiers go...

221
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:20,650
跟着他们就可找到上校
Follow them to the Colonel.

222
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,830
高巴
Koba?

223
00:38:56,390 --> 00:39:02,710
猿猴不会杀害猿猴
Apes do not kill Apes.

224
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,680
士兵开始离开了！
The soldiers are leaving!

225
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,420
他们停下来
They stopped.

226
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,220
他们向什么东西开火射击？
What are they shooting at?

227
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,360
我不知道
I do not know.

228
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:39,010
为何他们开枪射你？
Why did they shoot you?

229
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,920
和她一样！
Like her!

230
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,000
他也不能说话！
He cannot Speak!

231
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:11,020
他的伤势会引致他死亡
He will die of those wounds.

232
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,550
路加
Luca.

233
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:45,190
那些士兵去了哪里？！
Where did the soldiers go ?!

234
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:49,370
温达说他们向边境方向去了
Winter said they were going to the border.

235
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:51,740
是的，但确实方向在哪儿？！
Yes, but which way is that?!

236
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:43,480
坏...猿猴
Bad... Ape.

00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:51,700
坏猿猴
Bad Ape.

238

你是谁？
Who are you?

239
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:58,450
你在这里干什么？
What are you doing here?

240
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:02,920
我不认为他明白
I do not think he understands.

241
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,410
我不认识他
I don't recongnize him

242
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,800
他不是我们族群的一份子
He's not one of us.

243
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:14,040
你是否在这里孤身独处？
Are you alone here?

244
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:35,130
好冷
Cold?

245
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:53,020
好冷
Cold.

246
00:47:57,470 --> 00:48:00,570
我看见女孩，我以为你们是人类

247
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,870
但你猿猴们，像我一样！

248
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,870
不，不，不要放下
No no, don't put down.

249
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:14,470
- 你在这里待了多久？     - 很长时间，很久的一段时间！
- How long have you been here?     - Long time, long long time!

250
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:26,920

内华达动物园

253
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:36,690
这里还有像你的猿猴吗？

- 由动物园来的更多猿猴？     - 死了，全都死了！
- More Apes from Zoo?     - Dead, all dead!

猿猴变得聪明

之后人类杀光了猿猴，但不包括我
Then human killed Apes, but not me.

258
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:56,560
我逃跑了
I run.

259
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:59,110
你如何学会说话？

260
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:02,490
听人类说话学的
Listened human.

261

总是认为我们族群是独有的
Always thought we were the only ones.

269
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:42,250
奇迹地这世上原来还有更多

270
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:46,260
更多猿猴像我们一样

这东西从哪里得来？

00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:07,510
一个坏地方

277

在我抵达动物园很久以前就找到了

我在寻找食物，结果找到人类动物园
I look for food, I found human zoo.

279
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:17,950
收留病患的动物园？
Zoo for sick?

280
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,340
巨大的围墙！ 患病的人类... 爬着
Big walls! Sick human... climb

281
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:27,210
坏人类被杀

之后，所有人患病了，所有人都死了。 以前，很久以前

283
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:36,930
坏人类？

284
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:39,910
士兵？

285
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:44,010
士兵

286
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:45,880
一个逃兵集中营！
A deserted military camp!

287
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:48,690
就在边境里！
On the border!

288
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:53,440
或许上校与他的军队就是往哪里去了
Maybe the Colonel and the troops are going there?

289

- 它远吗？ 你能带我们去吗？     - 人类动物园？
- Is it far? Can you take us?     - Human zoo?

- Never go back!     - Please. You must take us.

293
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:09,220
不要！不要！ 不不不！
No!   No!  No, no no

我看见你现在正注视着她

你看似伤感

317
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:46,070
或许吧
Maybe.

318
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:50,010
之后
Then

319
00:53:54,650 --> 00:53:58,260
或许我带你去
Maybe I'll take you.

320
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:42,310
口渴
Thirsty.

321
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:45,740
口渴
Thirsty.

322
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:49,970
口渴
Thirsty.

323
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:07,550
路加，来吧。 走近一点
Luca, come on. Let's get closer.

324
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:09,650
保护他们安全
Keep them save

325
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:17,410
他们在干什么？
What are they doing?

326
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:19,410
我不知道
I do not know.

327
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:26,440
那是什么？ 巡逻队？
What's that? A Patrol?

328
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:29,370
我看不见策骑者
I do not see riders.

329
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:35,910
不要动！
Hold it!

330
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,060
我看见他们过来！
I saw them coming!

331
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:14,360
至少这一次...
At least this time...

332
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:17,250
我能够保护你
I was able to protect you.

333
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:30,450
凯撒
Caesar...

334
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:34,500
这必须停止
This must stop.

335
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:36,900
让其它猿猴参与进来还不算太迟
It's not too late to join other Apes...

336
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:39,960
我们已不能回头了！
We cannot turn back!

337
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:43,170
路加献出了自己的生命！
Luca gave his life!

338
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,970
求你了！
Please!

339
00:58:50,430 --> 00:58:52,130
他们必须付出代价
They must pay.

340
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:00,510
现在...
Now...

341
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:03,620
你的语气就像高巴
You sound like Koba.

342
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:12,290
带你们一起来是一个错误
It was a mistake to bring you all.

343
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:15,010
这是我的战斗
This is my fight.

344
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:17,130
我会完成所有事情
I'll finish this all.

345
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:21,130
去吧，现在
Go. Now.

346
00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:23,610
去加入其它猿猴群
Join the others.

347
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:54,350
发生了什么事？
What happened?

348
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:59,550
他们不知从那里走出来
They came out of nowhere...

349
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,500
攻击我们
Attacked us.

350
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:04,830
我们皆以为他们会将我们全体杀了
We thought they would kill us all...

351
01:01:05,310 --> 01:01:07,510
但上校阻止了他们
But the Colonel stopped them!

352
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:11,220
他眼中有点疯狂！
There was madness in his eyes!

353
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:16,390
他说他们可在我们死前加以利用！
He said they would use us, before we died!

354
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:19,020
之后他们把我们都带到这里来！
And they brought us all here!

355
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:23,120
你慢慢说
You easy

356
01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:27,580
他们强迫我们工作！
They've been forcing us to work!

357
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:32,010
什么样的工作？
What kind of work?

358
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:38,370
等等！ 我的小儿子也在这里吗？
Wait! My little son is here?

359
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:50,560
格林姆
Grame

360
01:01:51,450 --> 01:01:53,190
和 纳里
And Nali

361
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,780
威灵顿
Wellington

362
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:01,800
和 拿破仑
And Napoleon

363
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:06,160
卡斯托
Castor

364
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:09,710
和 锡廷伯恩
And Sittingbourne.

365
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:15,200
你可能没有多大的放心
You probably not much relieve

366
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:19,530
但这是个伟大时刻
but this is a big moment.

367
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:22,690
你在那里？
Where were you?

368
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:27,540
我们来到你的牧群中，你非常幸运
we came upon your herd. You got lucky.

369
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:31,070
但我非常惊讶你没与他们为伍
But I am surprised you weren't with them.

370
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:45,970
我希望你不要带着遗憾地到来拯救他的生命
I hope you don't come with regret to sparing his life.

371
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:48,960
这枪射得非常好
It's quiet a good shot.

372
01:02:55,310 --> 01:02:58,430
你最终有否救出你的猿猴？
Have you finally come to save your Apes?

373
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:01,180
我为你而来
I came for you.

374
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,620
为我？
For me?

375
01:03:06,050 --> 01:03:08,020
那晚我杀了的是谁？
Who did I killed that night?

376
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:10,160
我的妻子
My wife.

377
01:03:11,610 --> 01:03:14,190
我的儿子
My son.

378
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,620
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

379
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:29,650
本来去那里是找你
I was there for you.

380
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:42,910
我的天
My God.

381
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:45,080
看看你的眼睛
Look at your eyes.

382
01:03:46,270 --> 01:03:48,010
差不多成了人类
Almost human.

383
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:56,810
- 你怎知道我在这里？     - 别人告知你到这里来
- How did you know I was here?     - I was told you are coming

384
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:00,450
更多士兵由北方到来
More soldiers from the north.

385
01:04:01,790 --> 01:04:04,780
- 将会与你在此会合     - 与我会合？
- Would be joining you here.     - Joining me?

386
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:06,660
将我们全体收拾掉
To finish us all

387
01:04:08,270 --> 01:04:09,970
永久地
For good

388
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:14,170
谁告诉你的？
Who told you that?

389
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:25,150
好了
Okay

390
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:28,960
走吧
Let's go.

391
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,740
父亲！
Father!

392
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:12,640
父亲！
Father!

393
01:06:34,410 --> 01:06:35,610
力克
Lake.

394
01:06:36,670 --> 01:06:38,200
原谅他们
Forgive them

395
01:06:38,410 --> 01:06:41,110
我们经历了不少
We've been through much.

396
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:50,380
父亲！
Father!

397
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:54,510
我干了什么？
What did I done?

398
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:35,050
营队，停步！
Battalion, Halt!

399
01:07:40,610 --> 01:07:43,130
- 血     - 能使草生长！
- Blood!     - Make grass grow!

400
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:46,160
- 我们！     - 让血流动！
- We!     - Make blood flow!

401
01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:48,940
- 我们是个开始！     - 战斗到底！
- We are the beginning!     - At the end!

402
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:34,900
我们到这里后得不到水及食物
We haven't had food or water since we got here...

403
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:42,960
为何他们需要围墙？
Why do they need a wall?

404
01:09:58,460 --> 01:09:59,860
唏...
Hey...

405
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:03,460
唏唏唏唏...
Hey hey hey hey...

406
01:10:16,910 --> 01:10:20,210
唏... 猩猩！
Hey... Donkey!

407
01:10:21,290 --> 01:10:23,610
- 抬走他     - 知道
- Get him!     - Okay.

408
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:24,740
好了
Okay

409
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:55,940
停手！
Leave him!

410
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:40,730
- 告诉他们让这里恢复工作     - 猿猴们需要食物和食水
- Tell them made it back to work.     - Apes need food and water.

411
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:48,090
- 告诉他们     - 给他们食物和食水
- Tell them.     - Give them food and water.

412
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:58,140
五
Five

413
01:13:58,950 --> 01:14:00,650
四
Four

414
01:14:01,510 --> 01:14:03,210
三
Three

415
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:06,320
二
Two

416
01:14:23,170 --> 01:14:26,500
快！ 回去工作！
Hurry! Back to work!

417
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:45,950
把他绑起来，猩猩
String him up, donkey.

418
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:58,370
坏地方
Bad place

419
01:15:00,610 --> 01:15:02,440
很坏的地方
Bad, bad place.

420
01:15:05,010 --> 01:15:06,610
你看到什么？
What you see?

421
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:14,210
一定要救他们！
Must save them!

422
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:15,310
但怎样救？
But how?

423
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:16,710
要想想！
Must think!

424
01:15:16,710 --> 01:15:19,210
凯撒会怎样干？
What would Caesar do?

425
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:21,960
噢，不好！
Oh No!

426
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:25,800
为何这么小？
Why so small?

427
01:15:58,740 --> 01:16:01,110
为何上校答允你？
What did the Colonel promised you?

428
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:07,350
你真的认为他会在我们死后放过你？
You really think he let you live after we are gone?

429
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:10,950
你让他们叫你“猩猩”
You let them call you "Donkey".

430
01:16:11,690 --> 01:16:13,670
你是猿猴族人
You are Ape.

431
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:26,350
上校想要见你
Colonel wants to see you.

432
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:45,720
历史

433
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:55,180
若再次阻扰工作进程，我会开始一个接一个地屠杀猿猴
Interfere with the work again, I began slaughter at the Apes one by one.

434
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:57,840
明白吗？ 我需要那围墙
Understand? I need that wall.

435
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:00,970
猿猴需要食物和食水
Apes need food and water.

436
01:17:00,970 --> 01:17:04,370
当他们完成工作后才有食物和食水
They'll get food and water when they finish their work.

437
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:09,360
给猿猴食物和食水
Give Apes food and water.

438
01:17:09,770 --> 01:17:13,700
- 否则他们不能完成工作     - 你知吗，你太情绪化了
- or they cannot finish it.     - You know, you're very emotional.

439
01:17:16,210 --> 01:17:20,030
有何事让你认为，你有提出要求的资格？
What makes you think you are in position to make demands?

440
01:17:25,390 --> 01:17:28,710
- 好吧，开始     - 士兵往这里来了
- Okay, let's go.     - The soldiers were coming here.

441
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:32,410
他们不是为了加入你们而来，是吗？
They're not coming to joining you, are they?

442
01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:38,240
我看到围墙外有很多人为战争准备着
I've saw men outside on the wall preparing for battle.

443
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:45,480
他们告诉我你非常聪明，看来真的令我印象深刻
They told me you're smart, but that's impressive.

444
01:17:45,670 --> 01:17:49,390
是的，他们并不是加入我方
No, they won't be joining me.

445
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:51,120
他们反抗你吗？
They are against you?

446
01:17:51,330 --> 01:17:53,740
他们害怕我
They fear me.

447
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:57,830
为什么？ 因为你屠杀了你的手下？
Why? Because you kill your own men?

448
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:00,960
我们发现很多尸体
We found bodies.

449
01:18:01,390 --> 01:18:04,770
这些死人都有点问题
Something wrong with these men.

450
01:18:08,130 --> 01:18:11,220
天主上帝，你真有感染力
Jesus Christ, you are impressive.

451
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:16,540
你绘了一幅大图画。 你是这样看我的？！
You paint quiet a picture. What you must think of me ?!

452
01:18:17,550 --> 01:18:20,040
我认为你没一点恻隐之心
I think you have no mercy.

453
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:40,420
你来这里是为了杀我
You came here to kill me.

454
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:44,010
你要展示给我看什么是恻隐之心？
Were you gonna show me mercy?

455
01:18:44,050 --> 01:18:48,230
我放过你的手下时，就展示了恻隐之心
I showed you mery when I spare your men.

456
01:18:48,810 --> 01:18:53,320
我给你和平的机会，而你却杀了我的家人
I offered you peace, and you killed my family.

457
01:19:08,220 --> 01:19:09,920
仁慈
Mercy.

458
01:19:10,570 --> 01:19:13,810
你是否真的明白对我们施与仁慈的真正意义？
Do you have any idea what you mercy would do to us?

459
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:19,830
你定是比我们坚强
You're must stronger than we are.

460
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:22,760
聪明得如此
Smart as hell.

461
01:19:23,310 --> 01:19:27,690
不论你如何说，最终你做出了中止自然规律的行为
No matter what you say. Eventually, you play suspended the law of nature.

462
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:30,970
铁证在前，我们创造了你
The irony is, we created you.

463
01:19:30,970 --> 01:19:34,090
你试图蔑视大自然，屈服于我们的意愿之外
You tried to defy nature, bend it to our will.

464
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:38,400
大自然为了我们如此的傲慢而惩罚了我们
And nature has been punishing us for our arrogance ever since.

465
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:45,090
十个月前，我派出侦察队去搜索你的基地
Ten months ago, I sent out recon units to look for your base.

466
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:48,280
我的亲儿子是侦察队中的一名士兵
My own son was a soldier with one of the units.

467
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:51,050
有一天他突然不再说话
One day he suddenly stopped speaking.

468
01:19:51,050 --> 01:19:53,420
他变成了原始人，像一头动物
He became a primitive, like an animal.

469
01:19:53,690 --> 01:19:57,180
他们与我联络，说他们认为我儿子失了心智
They contact with me, and said that they though he lost his mind,

470
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:00,310
这场战争让他承受太多了
The war is too much for him.

471
01:20:01,490 --> 01:20:04,500
之后带领我儿子的士兵也同样不再说话了
Then the man who carried for him stopped speaking too.

472
01:20:05,860 --> 01:20:10,370
军医在停止说话前提出了一个理论
The medic had a theory, before he stopped speaking,

473
01:20:10,540 --> 01:20:13,160
出现了一种病毒几乎扫清了我们
that the virus that almost wiped us out,

474
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:16,750
每个人类幸存者依然携带着病毒
The virus that every human survivor still carries,

475
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:21,010
情况突然转变，病毒异变了！
Had suddenly changed, mutant!

476
01:20:22,970 --> 01:20:28,070
如果异变了的病毒蔓延开去，这次将永久性地摧毁人类族群
And if it is spread, it would destroy humanity for good this time.

477
01:20:29,650 --> 01:20:35,380
不是为了杀戮我们，而是为了掠夺我们人类、
Not by killing us, but by robbing us of those things that make us human.

478
01:20:35,770 --> 01:20:39,920
我们的语言、我们高阶的思维，将我们变成一头怪物！
Our speech, our higher thinking. It would turn us into beasts!

479
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:42,760
你跟我谈仁慈吗？
You talk about mercy?

480
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:46,380
你会怎么干？
What would you have done?

481
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:52,180
就是这个时刻让我清省了
It was a moment of clarity for me.

482
01:20:52,390 --> 01:20:56,580
我明白到我将要牺牲我唯一的儿子
I realized that I would have to sacrifice my only son,

483
01:20:56,620 --> 01:20:59,870
来拯救人类族群
so that humanlity could be saved.

484
01:21:02,610 --> 01:21:07,860
我拿着枪在手良久
I held that gun in my hand for a long time...

485
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:15,760
最终把枪指向我唯一的儿子
I pointed it at my only child.

486
01:21:18,350 --> 01:21:22,890
他双眼里带着信任凝望着我
He looked me with trust in his eyes.

487
01:21:24,930 --> 01:21:29,320
甚至在他原始的目光里
Even in his primitive gaze,

488
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:35,130
我感觉到他的...
I felt his...

489
01:21:36,310 --> 01:21:38,030
爱
Love.

490
01:21:43,850 --> 01:21:45,610
我扣下枪板
I pulled the trigger.

491
01:21:47,930 --> 01:21:50,050
它净化了我
It purify me.

492
01:21:51,530 --> 01:21:53,950
这使我的目标更为明确
It made my purpose clear.

493
01:21:55,860 --> 01:21:59,950
我下达了命令去杀尽所有已受感染的人
I gave the order to kill the others infected, all of them.

494
01:22:00,110 --> 01:22:04,190
烧光他们的随身物品及会引致污染扩散的所有东西
Burn their belongings, and anything that might spread contamination.

495
01:22:04,590 --> 01:22:07,090
他们中一些人质疑我的判断
Some of the men questioned my judgement.

496
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:10,450
我问他们能否依样葫芦地跟我干同样的事
I was asking them to do what I had done,

497
01:22:10,540 --> 01:22:15,360
牺牲他们的朋友及他们的家庭
To sacrifice their friends, their family.

498
01:22:18,270 --> 01:22:20,490
当然地，他们拒绝了！
Of course, they refused.

499
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:24,840
因此我把他们也杀了
So I had them killed too.

500
01:22:27,030 --> 01:22:31,640
其它人带着孩子们逃往丛林去
Others with children deserted into the woods.

501
01:22:32,950 --> 01:22:36,930
当中有一位懦夫竟跑到我北方上司那里
One of those cowards fled to my superiors up north.

502
01:22:36,970 --> 01:22:41,650
他们想说服我，说这疫症是有药可治
They tried to convince me that this plague could be dealt with medically.

503
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:48,490
之后我才真正认识到，他们根本没从过去中汲取教训
Then I realized that they had learn nothing from our past.

504
01:22:49,650 --> 01:22:52,330
你也把他们杀掉？
You killed them too?

505
01:22:54,230 --> 01:22:56,590
我干了什么，牧师？
What did I do, Preacher?

506
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:59,340
你劈下了他们的脑袋，长官
You severed their head, sir.

507
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:02,440
除了一个，我放过了他
Except for the one I spared

508
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:05,490
好让他能回去传递一个讯息
so that he could return to delivery a message.

509
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:08,530
如果他们想解除我的命令
If they want to relieve me of my commands

510
01:23:08,570 --> 01:23:13,090
他们将要与我在此见面，由他们自己来干
They'll have to meet me here, do it themselves.

511
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:15,760
以前这里是个武器库
This used to be a weapons' depot.

512
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:20,590
当危机开始发生时，他们把这里改为一个重置营
They turn it into a relocation camp when the crisis was just beginning.

513
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:25,620
那些武器仍然保存在这里的山中
But the weapon are all still here, inside the mountain.

514
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:29,040
有多少人将会到来？
How many men will be coming?

515
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:31,030
可能是全数人
Probably all of them.

516
01:23:31,030 --> 01:23:32,960
但不要想歪了
But don't get any idea,

517
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:36,000
他们唯一恐惧的东西不是我，而是你们猿猴
the only thing they fear more than me is you Apes.

518
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:47,200
这就是一场圣战
This is a holy war.

519
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:52,520
所有人类历史都导引至此刻
All the human history led to this moment.

520
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:57,780
如果我们失败，我们将是种族里的最后一群
If we lose, we'll be the last of our kind.

521
01:23:58,250 --> 01:24:04,610
这将变成猿猴星球，而我们将变成你们的牲口
It will be a planet of Apes, and we'll become your cattle.

522
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,700
看看你
Look at you.

523
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:11,330
你认为我很病态了，是吗？
You think I am sick, don't you?

524
01:24:19,610 --> 01:24:21,980
我不是存心要杀害你的儿子
I didn't mean to kill your son.

525
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:28,420
但如果他的命运是为了继承你那不神圣的王国
But if his destiny was to inherit your unholy kingdom.

526
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:31,560
我喜欢这样
I like this.

527
01:24:34,190 --> 01:24:36,590
拖他出去，快出去！
Get out, come on get out!

528
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:46,560
那么情绪化！
So emotional!

529
01:24:53,890 --> 01:24:56,070
我看到你有多么的矛盾
I see how conflicted you are.

530
01:24:57,100 --> 01:25:00,180
你对你的目标感到困惑
You are confused in your purpose.

531
01:25:00,620 --> 01:25:05,230
因我干了一些战争行为的事，而令你感到非常愤怒
You are angry at me for something I did that was an act of war.

532
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:10,000
但你对这事的处理太个人化了
But you're taking this all much far too personally.

533
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:17,230
你认为我的手下会如何处置你们猿猴？
What do you think my men would have done to your Apes,

534
01:25:17,230 --> 01:25:19,050
如果你杀了我？
If you killed me?

535
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:22,800
或许还是杀了我才最重要吧？
Or still killing me is more important?

536
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:37,700
四处都是士兵！
Soldiers everywhere!

537
01:25:37,780 --> 01:25:39,300
我们如何进去？
How will we get in?

538
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:42,740
一定有方法进去
Must get in somehow.

539
01:25:42,740 --> 01:25:44,440
一定要进去！
Must get in!

540
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:48,260
入去
Go in?

541
01:25:48,870 --> 01:25:50,370
不
No!

542
01:25:50,370 --> 01:25:52,910
不要入去！ 不可以！
No go in! Not!

543
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:04,200
朋友！ 朋友！ 不可以！ 不要入去！
Friends! Friends! Not! No go in!

544
01:26:04,330 --> 01:26:06,800
不要去，不要入去！
No go, no go in!

545
01:26:09,530 --> 01:26:11,740
朋友！ 朋友！
Friend! Friend!

546
01:26:15,890 --> 01:26:18,080
多谢，多谢朋友们
Thank you. Thank you, friends.

547
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:06,840
你拯救了我们的生命！
You save our lives!

548
01:27:47,730 --> 01:27:50,110
患病的人类
Sick humans...

549
01:27:50,130 --> 01:27:53,010
一定是在这里逃脱的！
...must have escaped down here!

550
01:27:57,470 --> 01:28:02,810
不，不！ 不可攀爬！ 不可！
No, no! No climb! No!

551
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:19,450
什么？ 你看见什么？
What? What do you see?

552
01:28:26,190 --> 01:28:27,970
究竟我们在哪里？
Wonder where we are?

553
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:55,010
噢，不要！ 我的朋友
Oh, no! Friend...

554
01:28:59,130 --> 01:29:00,830
不！
No!

555
01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:03,160
不！
No!

556
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:05,240
不！ 不要！
No! Not!

557
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,980
不！ 快回来，回来！
No! Come come!

558
01:29:11,450 --> 01:29:13,840
快回来，回来！ 回来，回来！
Come on, come! Come come!

559
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:16,380
不！ 快回来！
No! Come on!

560
01:29:16,650 --> 01:29:18,350
回来，回来！ 回来，回来！
Come come! Come come!

561
01:29:50,950 --> 01:29:52,650
高巴
Koba.

562
01:29:57,950 --> 01:29:59,650
睡吧
Sleep.

563
01:30:00,190 --> 01:30:02,430
你救不了他们
You cannot save them.

564
01:30:04,590 --> 01:30:07,850
所有猿猴都死在这里
Apes all die here.

565
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:13,220
- 不可！     - 是的！
- No!     - Yes!

566
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:17,810
加入我吧
Join me...

567
01:30:34,490 --> 01:30:36,890
如果明早他还活着
If he's still alive in the morning.

568
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:45,330
他也要像其它猿猴一样回去工作
He goes back to work like everyone else.

569
01:30:46,290 --> 01:30:48,090
否则射杀他
either shoot him.

570
01:30:48,390 --> 01:30:51,670
来，来，来
Come. Come. Come.

571
01:30:54,890 --> 01:30:56,590
小女孩入去了！
She go in!

572
01:32:04,380 --> 01:32:06,870
口渴吗？
Thirsty?

573
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:26,870
躲起来，你快点
Hide. Hurry you.

574
01:34:36,230 --> 01:34:38,250
人类会杀了她！
Humans will kill her!

575
01:34:39,860 --> 01:34:42,070
我知要干什么！ 走吧！
I know what to do! Go!

576
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:17,300
外面还有其它猿猴吗？
Are there others out there?

577
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:26,780
清理整片区域
Sweep the area.

578
01:36:27,870 --> 01:36:29,570
把牠关进去
Put him in the pen.

579
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:15,620
感觉好些了吗？
Feel better?

580
01:37:20,590 --> 01:37:21,830
好些了
Good.

581
01:37:21,940 --> 01:37:23,630
这样我们可谈谈关于...
Then we can talk about...

582
01:37:24,130 --> 01:37:26,030
逃走之事
Escape

583
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:28,890
猿猴们团结就会强大！
Apes together strong!

584
01:37:38,190 --> 01:37:40,580
- 我们是个开始！     - 战斗到底！
- We are the beginning!     - And the end!

585
01:38:04,590 --> 01:38:06,290
仍活着
Still alive.

586
01:38:37,780 --> 01:38:39,640
单独送他到采石场
Send him to the quarry alone.

587
01:38:43,170 --> 01:38:44,440
等等
Hold on

588
01:39:03,450 --> 01:39:05,150
这是什么？
What is this?

589
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:10,660
这东西怎样进来？
How did this get in there?

590
01:39:13,850 --> 01:39:15,550
带他去工作
Get him to work.

591
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:30,380
三十七
Thirty-seven.

592
01:39:41,020 --> 01:39:42,130
五十五
Fifty five.

593
01:39:44,610 --> 01:39:47,110
三十七步到成人牢笼
Thirty-seven steps to the adult cage...

594
01:39:47,150 --> 01:39:49,350
五十五步到幼儿牢笼
Fifty-five to the children.

595
01:40:28,700 --> 01:40:34,380
你知吗，当围墙建成后上校会射杀所有猿猴
You know, Colonel shoot Apes when wall is done.

596
01:40:38,020 --> 01:40:41,580
这围墙太疯狂了
This wall is madness.

597
01:40:42,140 --> 01:40:44,020
救不了他
It won't save him.

598
01:40:45,630 --> 01:40:47,810
我可干什么事能拯救你
Anymore that I did to save you.

599
01:40:48,070 --> 01:40:49,900
我会拯救自己
I save of myself.

600
01:40:50,870 --> 01:40:55,930
这里可有东西要你去拯救的吗？
Is there anything left...left you to save?

601
01:41:18,230 --> 01:41:19,930
往上！
Up!

602
01:41:36,820 --> 01:41:38,520
猿猴们是否返回牢笼中？
Apes going back to the cage?

603
01:41:42,310 --> 01:41:43,710
妳...
You...

604
01:41:44,510 --> 01:41:45,790
非常勇敢
Are very brave.

605
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,230
勇敢？
Brave?

606
01:41:48,430 --> 01:41:49,940
勇敢！
Brave!

607
01:41:50,140 --> 01:41:51,840
勇敢！
Brave!

608
01:41:56,750 --> 01:41:58,150
猿猴？
Ape?

609
01:42:00,180 --> 01:42:01,320
我...？
Me...?

610
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:03,220
猿猴？
Ape?

611
01:42:10,920 --> 01:42:12,320
妳是...
You are...

612
01:42:24,890 --> 01:42:26,590
诺娃
Nova.

613
01:42:28,950 --> 01:42:30,650
诺娃
Nova.

614
01:42:41,630 --> 01:42:43,330
来，来，来看看！
Come, Come, Come to see!

615
01:42:43,530 --> 01:42:44,550
来看看！
Come to see!

616
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:47,860
来！ 来看看！
Come ! Come to see!

617
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:07,790
三十四、三十五、三十六、三十七！三十！三十七！
34, 35, 36, 37! 30! 37!

618
01:43:10,510 --> 01:43:12,210
我干的
I do it.

619
01:43:14,180 --> 01:43:15,630
现在如何？
What now?

620
01:43:24,390 --> 01:43:25,830
什么？
What?

621
01:43:31,730 --> 01:43:33,630
噢，不要！
Oh, No!

622
01:43:34,310 --> 01:43:36,010
噢，不要！
Oh, No!

623
01:43:36,210 --> 01:43:38,530
不，不！不不不！
No, no! No, no, no!

624
01:43:44,250 --> 01:43:45,550
好了
Okay.

625
01:44:51,480 --> 01:44:54,120
这猿猴就是我给你谈论过的那只！
This is the apes I told you about!

626
01:44:56,040 --> 01:44:57,920
谢谢你
Thank you.

627
01:45:15,150 --> 01:45:16,470
坏猿猴
Bad Ape.

628
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:20,300
坏猿猴
Bad Ape.

629
01:45:22,300 --> 01:45:24,000
坏猿猴
Bad Ape.

630
01:45:37,140 --> 01:45:38,080
有何不妥？
What's wrong?

631
01:45:57,870 --> 01:45:59,030
我们不能继续掘了！
We can't keep digging!

632
01:45:59,270 --> 01:46:01,530
再掘水会灌满整条隧道！
It will flood the whole tunnel!

633
01:46:01,860 --> 01:46:04,890
如不掘下去，我们则不能到达幼儿牢笼那边！
If we don't, we can't reach the children!

634
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:25,980
我们必须在下面继续看看
We must keep looking down there...

635
01:46:25,980 --> 01:46:28,180
以便找出另一方法能到达幼儿牢笼
Find another way to reach the children...

636
01:46:28,410 --> 01:46:30,280
我们现在必须离开！
We must leave now!

637
01:46:30,510 --> 01:46:31,980
更多的士兵正来着！
More soldiers are coming!

638
01:46:32,450 --> 01:46:34,150
人类会互相残杀！
Humans will destroy each other!

639
01:46:34,350 --> 01:46:36,250
连我们也不放过！
And us with them!

640
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:42,700
我们将带幼儿们逃出地面去！
We'll have to get the children out above the ground!

641
01:46:43,550 --> 01:46:44,750
有何方法？
How?

642
01:47:19,290 --> 01:47:23,290
唏...你们这些畜牲！
Hey...You animals!

643
01:47:43,110 --> 01:47:44,810
是谁干的？
Who did that?

644
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:47,000
是谁干的？
Who did that?

645
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:53,260
究竟是谁？
Who was it?

646
01:48:00,670 --> 01:48:02,370
是你吗？
is you?

647
01:49:54,850 --> 01:49:57,220
我爱你，儿子
I love you, son.

648
01:51:06,990 --> 01:51:08,690
来吧，来吧
Come on, come on.

649
01:51:25,530 --> 01:51:26,930
赶快！ 走吧！
Hurry! Let's go!

650
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:33,700
凯撒，有何不妥？
Caesar, what's wrong?

651
01:51:44,790 --> 01:51:46,490
赶快！ 你必须走！
Hurry! You must go!

652
01:51:47,270 --> 01:51:49,030
没有你吗？
Without you?

653
01:51:49,750 --> 01:51:51,450
不了
No.

654
01:51:51,660 --> 01:51:53,360
莫利斯是对的
Morris was right.

655
01:51:58,280 --> 01:52:02,520
我干这些似足高巴
I did that like Koba.

656
01:52:03,350 --> 01:52:07,270
他逃不出他的仇恨
He could not escape his hate.

657
01:52:13,660 --> 01:52:16,000
可惜我仍不能逃避我自己
And I still can not escape mine.

658
01:52:22,300 --> 01:52:26,490
快走！ 走，走，走，走，走，走！
Move! Go, go, go, go, go, go!

659
01:53:10,850 --> 01:53:13,010
上校！ 上校！
Colonel! Colonel!

660
01:53:15,460 --> 01:53:17,160
他跑到哪里去了？
Whare the hell is he?

661
01:59:01,450 --> 01:59:03,050
上校，你在吗？
Colonel, Are you in there?

662
01:59:03,150 --> 01:59:04,150
上校？
Colonel?

663
01:59:46,870 --> 01:59:49,590
猩猩！ 榴弹发射器！
Donkey! Grenade launcher!

664
02:00:46,740 --> 02:00:49,430
老天该死的猩猩！ 快给我发射器！
God damn it, donkey! Get me the launcher!

665
02:04:59,830 --> 02:05:03,830
噢，不要！不，不，不！
Oh, No! No, no, no!

666
02:09:09,030 --> 02:09:11,130
不用担心
Don't worry

667
02:09:16,030 --> 02:09:17,030
莫利斯
Morris

668
02:09:20,930 --> 02:09:26,630
你现在已在家园了
You are on home now

669
02:09:29,230 --> 02:09:32,830
猿猴全族都很强大...
Apes all strong...

670
02:09:35,630 --> 02:09:40,430
就算有没有我也一样
with or without me

671
02:10:07,830 --> 02:10:45,330
子孙们将会知道谁是众人之父，与及凯撒为我们所付出的一切
Son will know who was father and what Caesar did for us.

672
02:11:50,830 --> 02:11:51,830
凯撒
Caesar

What the hell? He's big now. I gotta go. Hang on.

159
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:37,530
简直不要太赞 斯塔克先生说 "嗨 新来的"
It was the most amazing thing! Mr. Stark was like, "Hey, Underoos!"

160
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,040
我一个空翻过去 偷了队长的盾牌 我跟所有人打招呼 "大家好啊"
I flipped in and stole Cap's shield. I was like, "What's up, everybody?"

161
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,830
然后... 嗨 稍等一下
And then... Hey, just a second!

162
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,710
马上就来
Coming!

163
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,290
嗨
Hey.

164
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,250
这墙隔音效果不太好
We have thin walls here.

165
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,220
你在干嘛 拍视频日记
What are you doing, a little video diary?

166
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,180
- 是啊 - 没关系
- Yeah. - It's all right.

167
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,030
- 我也会这么做 - 我跟他说过不能这样
- I'd do the same thing. - I told him not to.

168
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,220
- 他一直在拍 我会把内容都删掉的 - 好吧
- He was filming. I'm gonna wipe the chip. - Okay.

169
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,430
嗨 这样吧
Hey. You know what?

170
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,940
我们应该给梅婶录制一个你的不在场视频 准备好了吗
We should make an alibi video for your aunt anyway. You ready?

171
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,520
- 不在场证明 没问题 - 开拍了吗 进到镜头里来
- An alibi? Sure. Okay. - We rolling? Get in the frame.

172
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:10,400
嗨 梅 近来如何 你穿着什么 希望是清凉一点的
Hey, May. How you doing? What are you wearing? Something skimpy, I hope.

173
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:14,110
彼得 我刚才那话太没礼貌了 我们重新拍 你到时候可以剪辑一下
Peter, that's inappropriate. Let's start over. You can edit it.

174
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,200
一 二 三 嗨 梅
Three, two, one. Hey, May.

175
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:21,870
我的天 你都不知道你侄子这周末
My gosh, I wanted to tell you what an incredible job your nephew did...

176
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,920
在斯塔克实习生操练中表现有多好
this weekend at the Stark internship retreat.

177
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,710
另所有人都刮目相看
Everyone was impressed.

178
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,000
真是够了 有车并线 不好意思
Come on! It's a freaking merge. I'm sorry.

179
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,860
因为你不是在皇后大道上
This is because you're not on Queens Boulevard.

180
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,880
看到没 哈皮希望去做资产管理
See, Happy is hoping to get bumped up to asset management.

181
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,680
他之前是安全部门的主管 再之前是个司机
He was forehead of security, before that he was a driver.

182
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,810
这话请你私下再讲
That was a private conversation.

183
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,450
我不喜欢别人拿这事开玩笑 我也不想谈这事
I don't like joking about this. It was hard to talk about that.

184
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,980
- 不 说真的 他是不是总打呼噜 - 好了 我们到了
- No, seriously, was he snoring a bunch? - Here we are. End of the line.

185
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,320
- 哈皮 可以回避一下吗 - 你让我走开
- Can you give us a moment? - Want me to leave?

186
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,940
把彼得的箱子从后备箱拿出来
Grab Peter's case out of the trunk.

187
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,150
我能留着这套战衣
I can keep the suit?

188
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,410
可以 我们刚才说过了
Yes, we were just talking about it.

189
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,580
但请帮我个忙 哈皮是你的联络人
Do me a favor, though. Happy's kind of your point guy on this.

190
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,910
别总是惹毛他 别做蠢事
Don't stress him out. Don't do anything stupid.

191
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,000
我看过他的心电图
I've seen his cardiogram.

192
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,750
- 行吗 - 行
- All right? - Yes.

193
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,300
我做什么你都不要跟着做 也不要做我不会做的事
Don't do anything I would do, and don't do anything I wouldn't do.

194
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,420
两条界限之间有一小条灰色地带 这就是你的行事范围
There's a little gray area in there. That's where you operate.

195
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,720
- 等下 这意味着我是位复仇者 - 不
- Wait, does that mean I'm an Avenger? - No.

196
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,970
- 是这个吗 - 送上七楼
- This it? - Seventh floor.

197
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,560
- 我可以自己拿上去 不用劳烦你 - 你自己拿上去
- I can take that. You don't have to. - You'll take it?

198
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,100
- 嗯 我拿上去就好 - 谢谢
- Yeah, I can take that. - Thank you.

199
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,060
那我们下次"练手"是什么时候 你知道吗
So when's our next...? When's our next "retreat," you know?

200
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,100
你是说下次任务
What, next mission?

201
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,860
没错 我说的就是任务
Yeah, the mission. The missions.

202
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,660
我们会打给你
We'll call you.

203
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,860
你有我电话吗
Do you have my numbers?

204
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,400
不 我刚说的是"我们"会打给你
No, I mean, we'll call you.

205
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,570
有人会打给你的 行吗
Like, someone will call you. All right?

206
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,990
- 你们队里的人 - 好的 就这样吧
- From your team. - Okay. All right.

207
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,990
我不是想抱你 开车门而已 咱俩关系还没到那地步
It's not a hug. I'm just grabbing the door for you. We're not there yet.

208
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,710
回见
Bye.

209
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,630
他们会打给我的
They're gonna call me.

210
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,720
你好啊 "屁"得·帕克
What's up, Penis Parker?

211
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,440
欢迎大家收看《中城科技》
Rise and shine, Midtown Science and Technology.

212
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,560
别忘了带你们的返校日门票
Don't forget about your homecoming tickets.

213
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,360
你有返校日派对的男伴了吗
Do you have a date for homecoming?

214
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,650
谢了 詹森 但我已经有男伴了
Thanks, Jason, but I already have a date.

215
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,780
- 好吧 - 嗯
- Okay. - Yeah.

216
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:08,540
该死 你现在就去我办公室
Damn it. You, in my office right now.

217
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,940
加入我 跟我一起建立新的乐高死星
Join me, and together we'll build my new LEGO Death Star.

218
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,860
- 你说什么 - 真无趣
- What? - So lame.

219
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,610
太棒了 一共多少块
That's awesome. How many pieces?

220
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,610
三千八百零三块
Three thousand eight hundred and three.

221
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:42,030
- 太酷了 - 当然 你今晚想拼吗
- That's insane. - I know. You want to build it tonight?

222
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,110
不行 今晚不行 我还要去斯塔克...
No, I can't tonight. I've got the Stark...

223
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,950
- 斯塔克实习项目 - 对的 没错
- Stark internship. - Yeah, exactly.

224
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,370
总是为那个项目跑来跑去
Always got that internship.

225
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,450
希望最后能成功转正
Yeah, well, hopefully, soon it'll lead to a real job with them.

226
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,120
- 那样的话就太美妙了 - 是吧
- That would be so sweet. - Right?

227
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,670
大家都会说 "那些工作表做得真好 彼得
He'd be all, "Good job on those spreadsheets, Peter.

228
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:55,600
给你一枚金币做奖励"
Here's a gold coin."

229
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,900
我不知道真正的工作是怎样的
I don't know how jobs work.

230
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,170
他们就是这样工作的
That's exactly how they work.

231
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,050
我会先把死星的架构搭起来
I'll knock out the bones of the Death Star.

232
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:07,140
其他部分就好办了 因为底座最不好搭
I'll come by afterwards. For the most part, the difficult thing is the base of it.

233
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,900
上面那一部分我们最多两个小时就能搭建好
The top half we can knock out in two hours, tops.

234
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,810
那就太好了
That'd be great.

235
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,310
我要迟到了
I'm gonna be late.

236
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:21,070
好的 那我们如何计算A点和B点之间的距离
Okay, so how do we calculate linear acceleration between points A and B?

237
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,280
弗拉什
Flash.

238
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,490
质量除以正弦函数和重力
It's the product of sine of the angle and gravity divided by mass.

239
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,950
不对 彼得 你在听吗
Nope. Peter. You still with us?

240
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,370
在听 在听
Yeah, yeah.

241
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,880
质量被抵消 所以只需考虑重力倍数正弦
Mass cancels out, so it's just gravity times sine.

242
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,920
正确 看到没 弗拉什 答得快不一定答得对
Right. See, Flash, being the fastest isn't always the best if you are wrong.

243
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,720
你死定了
You're dead.

244
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,390
今天我们要说说丹麦物理学家 尼尔斯·玻尔
Today we're talking about Danish physicist Niels Bohr...

245
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:56,690
但相信我 玻尔有关量子学的理论一点都不枯燥
but trust me, there's nothing Bohr-ing about his discoveries regarding quantum theory.

246
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,700
莉兹穿的那件上衣是不是新的
Did Liz get a new top?

247
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,620
不 之前见她穿过 但那条超短裙没见过
No. We've seen that before, but never with that skirt.

248
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,620
- 莉兹 嗨 标语真漂亮 - 嗨
- Liz, hey. That looks so good. - Hi!

249
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,420
我们不能再盯着人家看了 不然太过诡异
We should probably stop staring before it gets creepy.

250
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,840
太迟了
Too late.

251
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,670
你们两个就是屌丝
You guys are losers.

252
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,050
那你为什么还要跟我们坐一起
Well, then why do you sit with us?

253
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,760
因为我没朋友
Because I don't have any friends.

254
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,760
下一个问题
Next question.

255
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,430
最重的自然元素是什么
What is the heaviest naturally-occurring element?

256
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,680
氢质量最轻
Hydrogen's the lightest.

257
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,310
问题不是这个 好吧
That's not the question. Okay.

258
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,690
- 好的 - 铀
- Yeah. - Uranium.

259
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,940
答对了 谢谢你 亚伯拉罕
Correct. Thank you, Abraham.

260
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,150
请将书本翻至第十页
Please open your books to page 10.

261
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,530
彼得 这可是全国竞赛啊
Peter, it's nationals.

262
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,900
你就不能休一个周末
Is there no way you could take one weekend off?

263
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:51,030
我去不了华盛顿 如果斯塔克先生需要我 我一定得过去
I can't go to Washington. If Mr. Stark needs me, I have to make sure I'm here.

264
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,580
你都没见过托尼·斯塔克
You've never been in the same room as Tony Stark.

265
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,000
等下 怎么了
Wait. What's happening?

266
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,120
- 彼得不能去华盛顿 - 不行
- Peter's not going to Washington. - No.

267
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:59,460
- 绝对不行 - 为什么不行
- No, no, no. - Why not?

268
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,340
真的吗 马上就要全国赛了
Really? Right before nationals?

269
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,170
他已经退出了军乐队和机器人实验室
He already quit marching band and robotics lab.

270
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,590
我没有迷恋他 不过善于观察罢了
I'm not obsessed with him. Just very observant.

271
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:10,010
弗拉什 那你替彼得去吧
Flash, you're in for Peter.

272
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,300
不好说 我得先看看自己的安排
I don't know. I gotta check my calendar first.

273
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,680
我还要跟黑寡妇约会呢
I got a hot date with Black Widow coming up.

274
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,640
纯粹瞎编
That is false.

275
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:20,190
又拿那个铃来搞笑 我之前是怎么跟你说的
What'd I tell you about using the bell for comedic purposes?

276
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,580
- 嗨 你好 - 嗨 伙计
- Hey, what's up? - Hey, man.

277
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,880
你好 德尔马先生
What's up, Mr. Delmar?

278
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,590
嗨 帕克先生
Hey, Mr. Parker.

279
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,960
还要五号套餐 对吗
Number five, right?

280
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,630
没错 还有腌黄瓜 你能把黄瓜压平吗 谢谢
Yeah, and with pickles, and can you smush it down real flat? Thanks.

281
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,800
知道了 老板
You got it, boss.

282
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,960
你婶婶怎么样
How's your aunt?

283
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,640
她挺好的
Yeah, she's all right.

284
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:57,350
她是个非常性感的意大利女人
She's a very hot Italian woman.

285
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,560
你女儿怎么样
How's your daughter?

286
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,190
- 十美元 - 明明是五美元
- Ten dollars. - It's 5 dollars.

287
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,300
让你嘴贱 十美元
For that comment, 10 dollars.

288
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,070
嗨 不是吧 我开个玩笑而已
Hey, come on. I'm joking. I'm joking.

289
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,570
给你五美元
Here's 5 dollars.

290
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,240
你好 默夫
What's up, Murph?

291
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,370
近来如何 小家伙
How you doing, buddy?

292
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,620
学校那边如何
So how's school?

293
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,750
无聊 不过我有更有意思的事情去做
It's boring. Got better things to do.

294
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:24,170
好好读书 孩子 不然你最后会落得我这样的下场
Stay in school, kid. Otherwise, you're gonna end up like me.

295
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,880
- 有家店也蛮好的 - 皇后区最好吃的三明治
- This is great. - Best sandwiches in Queens.

296
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,580
真不容易
Finally.

297
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000

哈皮 我刚遇到了一件超级奇怪的事 一伙抢自动取款机的人...
The craziest thing just happened. These guys were robbing an ATM...

- with high-tech weapons... - Take a breath. I don't have time...

366

- 处理自动取款机抢劫案... - 我知道 可是...

372
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,740
你怎么了
What about you?

373
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,950
万一斯塔克先生需要我 或者有什么要紧事呢
Well, what if Mr. Stark needs me or something big goes down?

374
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:31,580
- 我能跟斯塔克先生聊聊吗 - 远离过于危险事物就好
- Can I please talk to Mr. Stark? - Stay away from anything dangerous.

375
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,500
我必须要保证你负起责任来 懂吗
I'm responsible for making sure you're responsible, okay?

376
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,880

377
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,460
- 我的背包不见了 - 这听起来可不像很负责的样子
- My backpack's gone. - That doesn't sound responsible.

378
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,630
- 我回头再打给你 - 还是别了
- I'll call you back. - Feel free not to.

379
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,780
怎么回事
What was that?

380
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,320
没什么 没什么
It's nothing. Nothing.

381
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,200
你就是蜘蛛侠
You're the Spider-Man.

382
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,200
- 油管上的蜘蛛侠 - 我不是
- From YouTube. - I'm not. I'm not.

383
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:56,810
- 你刚在房顶上 - 不是的 你在我房间里干嘛
- You were on the ceiling. - No. What are you doing in my room?

那你也不能随便进我房间
You can't just bust into my room!

386
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:04,000
那个火鸡肉饼食谱一点都不靠谱
That turkey meatloaf recipe is a disaster.

387
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,800
我们吃晚饭吧 泰国菜如何 奈德 你爱吃泰国菜吗

392
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,350
- 她不知道吗 - 没人知道
- Oh, she doesn't know? - Nobody knows.

393
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,770
斯塔克先生知道 因为我这身战衣是他做的 就这样
Mr. Stark knows because he made my suit. That's it.

394
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:25,150

Tony Stark made you that? Are you an Avenger?

395
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:27,900
差不多吧
Yeah, basically.

396
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:32,360
这事儿你得保密 不能告诉其他人
You can't tell anybody about this. You gotta keep it a secret.

397
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,370
- 保密 为什么 - 你知道她的脾气
- Secret? Why? - You know what she's like.

398
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:37,610
如果让她知道每晚有人追着杀我 她一定不会同意让我继续的
If she finds out people try and kill me every night, she won't let me do this.

399
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,910
拜托 奈德 求你了
Come on, Ned, please.

400
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,790
好吧 好吧
Okay, okay, okay.

401
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,670
跟你说实话吧 我不觉得我能保守住这个秘密
I'll level with you. I can't keep this a secret.

402
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,730
这明明是很酷的事情嘛
It's the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.

403
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,420
奈德 不能让梅知道 我现在不能这么对她
Ned, May cannot know. I cannot do that to her right now.

404
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:52,340
她经历了那么多事 我... 拜托了
You know? I mean, everything that's happened with her, I... Please.

- 谢谢你 - 没关系
- Thank you. - Yeah.

408
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,190
居然被人发现了
I can't believe this is happening now.

409
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,610
- 我能试试你的战衣吗 - 不行
- Can I try the suit on? - No.

410
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:06,750
衣服上那些装置怎么用 有磁铁吗 你怎么发射粘液
How's it work? Magnets? How do you shoot the strings?

411
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,980
- 明天到学校了我再告诉你 - 太好了
- I'm gonna tell you at school tomorrow. - Great.

412
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:11,110
好 先等等

413
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,780
你又做蜘蛛侠 又参加斯塔克实习项目 是怎么做到的
How do you do this and the Stark internship?

你是怎么回事
What's the matter?

417
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,540
我还以为你喜欢吃碎肉沙拉
Thought you loved larb.

418
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:32,780
太碎了吗 那就是不够碎了
It's too larby? Not larby enough.

419
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:37,510
我要说多少次"碎肉沙拉" 你才肯跟我说话
How many times do I have to say "larb" before you talk to me?

420
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,850
你知道我爱你
You know I larb you.

421
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,060
我就是压力太大 那个实习生项目搞得我很累
I'm just stressed. The internship, and I'm tired.

422
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,270
工作量太大
A lot of work.

423
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,690
斯塔克实习项目
The Stark internship.

424
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,530
老实说 我不喜欢托尼·斯塔克
I have to tell you, not a fan of that Tony Stark.

425
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:54,910
你总是一副心不在焉的样子 他肯定给你洗脑了
You're distracted all the time. He's got you in your head.

426
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:58,160
- 德尔马三明治店毁于... - 他究竟让你在做什么
- Delmar's Sandwiches was destroyed... - What does he have you doing?

427
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,050
- 一场爆炸... - 你得跟着直觉走
- in an explosion... - You need to use your instincts.

428
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,210
皇后区的犯罪被一名从天而降的犯罪阻挡者阻止了
after an ATM robbery was thwarted by Queens' own crime stopper...

429
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,460
怎么了
What?

430
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,170
蜘蛛侠
the Spider-Man.

431
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,670
蜘蛛侠努力阻止劫匪时
As the Spider-Man attempted to foil their heist...

432
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,510
银行突然发生剧烈爆炸 路对面的熟食杂货店被炸得粉碎
a powerful blast was set off, slicing through the bodega across the street.

433
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,720
神奇的是 爆炸并没有造成人员伤亡
Miraculously, no one was harmed.

434
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,970
如果你遇到了那种事 一定要转身向反方向跑
If you spot something like that happening, you turn and you run the other way.

435
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,890
知道 知道 当然
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.

436
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,350
离我们就六个街区
Six blocks away from us.

437

你被蜘蛛咬了

445
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,960
它能咬我吗
Can it bite me?

446
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,960
不疼的 对吧
Well, it probably would've hurt, right?

447
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:53,420
管他呢 就算疼 我也会让它咬我
Whatever. Even if it did hurt, I'd let it bite me.

It's unknown. Shut up.

462

虽然他是个不折不扣的战犯 我还是得播放这个视频
Pretty sure he's a war criminal, but I have to show these videos.

472

这是州政府规定的 开始吧
It's required by the state. Let's do it.

475
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,620
- 他一定很好闻 - 赶紧闭嘴
- I bet he smells nice. - You have to shut up.

476
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:12,500
美国队长这人酷吗 或他是个尖酸刻薄的老头子
Is Captain America cool, or is he like a mean, old grandpa?

477
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,590
奈德 闭嘴 行吗
Ned, just... okay?

478
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:18,260

There'd be screens around me, and I could swivel around.

485
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:41,530
我想上雷神 嫁给钢铁侠 然后杀死绿巨人
Now, see, for me, it would be F Thor, marry Iron Man and kill Hulk.

486
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,530
那蜘蛛侠呢
Well, what about the Spider-Man?

487
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,910
蜘蛛侠就是蜘蛛侠
It's just Spider-Man.

488
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,290

491
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:53,750
- 算是吧 - 咦 好恶心哦

492
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,980
- 他差不多都30了 - 你都不知道他长什么样子
- He's probably 30. - You don't know what he looks like.

493
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,960
万一他被严重烧伤了呢
Like, what if he's seriously burned?

494
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:01,840
我不在乎 我爱的是他的品性
I wouldn't care. I'd love him for the person he is inside.

495
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,890
彼得认识蜘蛛侠
Peter knows Spider-Man.

496
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,850

威尔逊教练和美国队长还是"朋友"呢

499
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,360
我见过他 没错 见过几次
I've met him, yeah. A couple times.

500
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,900
不过是...
But it's...

501
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,780
通过斯塔克实习项目见到的
through the Stark internship.

502
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,570
对 我确实不该宣扬此事的
Yeah, well, I'm not really supposed to talk about it.

503
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,620
太棒了 这样吧
Well, that's awesome. Hey, you know what?

504
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,450
或许你可以邀请他参加莉兹的派对 好吗
Maybe you should invite him to Liz's party. Right?

505

- Having a party? - Yeah, it's gonna be dope.

507
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:39,460
你真该请你朋友蜘蛛侠过来
You should totally invite your personal friend Spider-Man.

508
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,170
没关系的
It's okay.

509
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,050
我理解彼得太忙 没时间参加派对 所以...
I know Peter's way too busy for parties anyway, so....

510
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,050
得了吧 他会去的 对吗 帕克
Come on. He'll be there. Right, Parker?

帮你啊
Helping you out.

513

Did you not hear her?

514
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,940
莉兹喜欢你

515

伙计 你可是复仇者联盟的
Dude, you're an Avenger.

516
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:08,490
如果真有人能约到高年级的姑娘 肯定非你莫属了
If any one of us has a chance with a senior girl, it's you.

517
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,290
郊区家庭派对
House party in the suburbs.

518
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,840
我还记得这种场景 我有点嫉妒你呢
Oh, I remember these. Kind of jealous.

519
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,210
这会是永生难忘的一夜
It'll be a night to remember.

520
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,510
奈德 有的帽子很挑人的 你戴这顶简直太帅了
Ned, some hats wear men. You wear that hat.

521
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:25,630
是啊 这帽子让我自信满满
Yeah, it gives me confidence.

522
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,010
我们不该来
This is a mistake.

523
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,430
我们回家吧
Hey, let's just go home.

524
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,060

我理解 你正值青春期
I know. I know it's really hard...

526
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,400
想要融入大伙儿真的很难
trying to fit in with all the changes your body's going through.

527
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,600
你现在可正值花季
It's flowering now.

528
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,860
他最近压力好大
He's so stressed out lately.

529
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,610
派对有助于缓解压力

夸赞所有人都很酷 跟我顶下拳 或者给我一个兄弟般的拥抱
say you guys are tight, and I get a fist bump or one of those half bro-hugs.

541
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:23,900
你们居然会参加这种无聊的派对
Can't believe you're at this lame party.

542
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,280
你不也在这儿嘛
But you're here too.

553
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,350
- 拜 - 拜

兄弟 你怎么想的
Dude, what are you doing?

555
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,770
她在这儿 赶紧变身蜘蛛人啊
She's here. Spider it up.

556
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,560
不 不行 我不能...不能这么做
No, no, no. I can't... I cannot do this.

557
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,980
蜘蛛侠不是什么派对上供人消遣的小把戏 知道吗
Spider-Man is not a party trick, okay?

558
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:06,820
我做好自己就行
Look, I'm just gonna be myself.

559
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:09,280
彼得 大家不喜欢这样
Peter, no one wants that.

560
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,240
伙计
Dude.

561
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:14,540
"屁"得·帕克 你好啊
Penis Parker, what's up?

562
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,540
你那位蜘蛛侠朋友呢
So where's your pal Spider-Man?

563
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,250
让我猜猜 跟你那假想中的女朋友一样在加拿大吗
Let me guess: In Canada with your imaginary girlfriend?

564
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,880
那才不是蜘蛛侠 不过是奈德穿上一件红色的衬衣
That's not Spider-Man. That's just Ned in a red shirt.

565
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,600
"嗨 你们好啊 我是蜘蛛侠
"Hey, what's up? I'm Spider-Man.

566
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,810
我就是过来跟我的兄弟彼得打个照顾
Just thought I'd swing by and say hello to my buddy Peter.

567
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,140
你好啊 奈德 彼得呢
Oh, what's up, Ned? Hey, where's Peter, anyways?

568
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,150

He must be around...."

569
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:49,570
老天 这样好傻啊 我在干嘛
God, this is stupid. What am I doing?

570
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,790
怎么回事
What the hell?

571
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,350
太糟糕了
This sucks.

572
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:31,900
这个是在从索科维亚回收的一件奥创替代性武器的基础上打造而成
Now, this is crafted from a reclaimed sub-Ultron arm straight from Sokovia.

573
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,360
给 你试试
Here. You try.

574
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,330
我不想要这么高调惹眼的武器 你干嘛要卖我这样的货 伙计
I wanted something low-key. Why are you trying to upsell me, man?

575
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,580
好吧 你想要的我这里也有 行了吧
Okay, okay. I got what you need, all right?

你现在公然放枪 赶紧的
You letting off shots in public now? Hurry up.

579
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:54,800
听着 时代在变 只有我们在卖这种高科技武器
Look, times are changing. We're the only ones selling these high-tech weapons.

580
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,220
那些抢劫自动取款机的人 肯定是在这里买的武器
This must be where the ATM robbers got their stuff.

581
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:02,770
我需要能把人粘住不动的武器 我可不想射人穿越时空
I need something to stick up somebody. I'm not trying to shoot them back in time.

582
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,150
我有抗重力攀登鞋
I got antigrav climbers.

583
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,400
攀登鞋
Yo, climbers?

584
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,190
怎么回事
Okay, what the hell is that?

嗨 来啊 你想开枪打人 向我开枪啊
Hey! Hey, come on. You gonna shoot at somebody, shoot at me.

没问题
All right.

588
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,640
怎么回事
What was that?

589
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:50,940
- 我们得给他打电话 - 不行 不行

590
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,910
你又开枪了
Did you just do it again?

591
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,240
- 闭嘴 - 我要给他打电话
- Shut up. - I'm calling him.

592
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:11,340

596
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,830

Sorry, no time to play. Here, go fetch.

599
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,750

Now, this is more like it.

600
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,560
好香啊
Smells really good.

601
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,190

嗨 我是彼得 请留言
Hey, it's Peter. Leave a message.

605
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:25,910
彼得 你在哪儿
Peter, where are you?

606
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,960
这帽子不管用 一点儿都不好玩
The hat's not working. This is not cool.

607
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
差点儿抓住你们
Almost got you.

608
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,470
你们以为能这么轻易甩掉我
Thought you got away from me, didn't you?

609
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,850
你们跑到哪儿我都追得上
I got you right where I want you.

610
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,850
惊喜
Surprise!

611
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,940
怎么回事
What the hell?

612
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,950
嗨
Oh, hey.

613
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:51,460
然后他像个怪物一样俯冲而下
And then he just, like, swooped down like a monster...

614
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:55,170
一把抓住我 飞到几千英尺高的地方 然后把我扔了下去
and picked me up, and took me up like a thousand feet and just dropped me.

615
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:58,170
你是怎么找到我的 是不是在我衣服里放了追踪器
How'd you find me? Did you put a tracker in my suit?

616
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,170
我往你衣服里放了很多东西
I put everything in your suit.

617
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,670
包括一个加热器
Including this heater.

618
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:07,350
这样感觉好多了 谢谢
That's better. Thanks.

619
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,680
你脑子进水了吗
What were you thinking?

620
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:12,140
那些武器都是那个长翅膀的男的卖出去的 我得把他拿下
The guy with wings is the source of the weapons. I gotta take him down.

621
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:13,980
你要拿下他 省省吧
Take him down now, huh?

622
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,940
那可是克罗克特炮 有专门的人会负责此事
Crockett, there are people who handle this sort of thing.

623
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,940
- 复仇者吗 - 不 这种小事还轮不到他们出手
- The Avengers? - No. This is a little below their pay grade.

624
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:22,110
不论如何 斯塔克先生 你没必要亲自过来的
Mr. Stark, you didn't have to come out here.

625
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,700
我应付得来 我没事
I had that. I was fine.

626
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,280
我没有亲自来
Oh, I'm not here.

627
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,950
好在这里有无线网
Thank God this place has Wi-Fi...

628
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,910
不然你现在早就倒大霉了
or you would be toast right now.

629
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,080
你真该烧柱高香 干杯
Thank Ganesh while you're at it. Cheers.

630
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,420
听着 别再管那个会飞的秃鹰男了 拜托
Look, forget the flying vulture guy, please.

631
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,630
- 为什么 - 这还用为什么
- Why? - Why?

632
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,840
因为这是我命令的啊
Because I said so!

633
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:44,010
抱歉 我在跟一个青少年说话
Sorry, I'm talking to a teenager.

634
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,630
脚踏实地点
Stay close to the ground.

635
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,850
多帮帮那些普通人 比如给你买西班牙油条的老太太
Build up your game helping little people, like that lady that bought you the churro.

636
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:53,390
你就不能当个友好的
Can't you just be a friendly...

637
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,390
邻家蜘蛛侠
neighborhood Spider-Man?

638
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,270
但我能做的不止这些小事
But I'm ready for more than that now.

639
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:58,810
不 你还不行
No, you're not.

640
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:01,300
我跟美国队长较量的时候 你可不是这么想的
That's not what you thought when I took on Captain America.

641
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,070
相信我 孩子 如果队长真想揍扁你 他一定做得到
Trust me, kid. If Cap wanted to lay you out, he would've.

642
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:08,990
听好了 你要是再遇到那种武器 直接给哈皮打电话
Listen to me. If you come across these weapons again, call Happy.

643
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,620
你在开车吗
Are you driving?

644
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:13,790
是时候该好好想想上大学的事了
You know, it's never too early to start thinking about college.

645
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,710
麻省理工学院那边我还算说得上话 我挂了
I got some pull at MIT. End call.

646
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:18,580
不 我不需要上...
No, I don't need to go to...

647
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,790
斯塔克先生已经挂断
Mr. Stark is no longer connected.

648
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,340
好酷啊
That's awesome.

649
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:31,430
"脚踏实地" 他这话什么意思
"Stay close to the ground"? What is he talking about?

650
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:52,160
伙计 怎么了 我马上回去
Hey, what's up? I'm on my way back.

651
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,540
其实我打电话 就是让你不要回来了 你听
Actually, I was calling to say maybe you shouldn't come. Listen.

652
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,870
我说"屁得" 你们说"帕克"
When I say "penis," you say "Parker."

653
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,080
- "屁"得 - 帕克
- Penis! - Parker!

654
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:00,460
- "屁"得 - 帕克
- Penis! - Parker!

655
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,210
抱歉 彼得 看来咱俩还是屌丝
Sorry, Peter. I guess we're still losers.

656
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:06,300
- 明天见 - 明天学校见
- I'll see you tomorrow. -I'll see you tomorrow in school.

657
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,050
一群蠢货
Idiots.

658
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,010
一群蠢货
Idiots.

659
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,720
一群蠢货
Idiots!

660
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:53,600
头儿
Boss?

661
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:57,220
你老婆一直给你发短信 貌似是刹车灯坏了
Your wife keeps texting you. Something about a brake light.

662
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,810
没跟你说过偷看我手机 会是什么下场吗
What'd I tell you about looking at my phone?

663
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,230
抱歉 你落到这里了
Sorry. You left it out.

664
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,230
你知道我这人天性好奇的
You know I'm a curious person by nature.

665
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:08,280
那个高海拔真空密封器已经设计好了
I finished designing that high-altitude vacuum seal.

666
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,530
如果你在高空飞行的时候 想要上大号的话
In case you want to, you know, go for the big one?

667
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,740
你还在设计那玩意儿 我跟你说过了 不要
You're still on that? I told you, no.

668
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,450
我不要 算了吧
The answer's no. Forget it.

669
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:30,590
真是太牛了
I mean, that was badass.

670
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:37,100
我跟你说过多少次了 不要用那些武器在公共场所开火
How many times have I told you not to fire them out in the open?

671
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,810
- 你说的嘛 扩大销售 - 低调行事
- You said, move the merchandise. - Under the radar.

672
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,190
低调行事
Under the radar!

673
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:43,100
我们就是这么熬过来的
That's how we survive.

674
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:46,610
你要是把损害控制部门或者复仇者引来 我们就完蛋了
If you bring Damage Control or the Avengers down here, we're through.

675
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:50,190
你在外边穿着那身笨蛋衣服 开着汽车
You're out there wearing that goofy thing, lighting up cars...

676
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,860
自称震撼者
calling yourself the Shocker.

677
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:55,160
"我是震撼者 我令人震撼" 这算什么 专业摔跤
"I'm the Shocker. I shock people." What is this, pro wrestling?

678
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,120
随你怎么说 伙计 得了吧
Whatever, old man. Come on.

679
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,000
听着
Look.

680
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,580
听着
Look.

681
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,420
我知道你什么都不在乎
I know you don't give a crap about anything.

682
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,210
但我在乎
But I do.

683
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,510
我辛苦经营这个地方 是因为我有人要照顾
I built this whole place because I got people I have to look after.

684
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:12,880
随便啦 随便啦
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

685
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,550
你知道吗
You know what?

686
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,390
我再也受不了你这狗屁态度了
I can't afford your bullshit.

687
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,020
- 你走吧 - 你说什么
- Get out of here. - What?

688
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:24,480
- 你走吧 你被解雇了 - 行啊 没问题
- You're done. You're off the crew. - Yeah, all right.

689
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,400
没问题
All right.

690
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,980
我还真挺想知道 炒了我你能否承受得住呢
Wonder if you can afford me out there, though, right?

691
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,980
毕竟我知道这么多
With everything I know.

692
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:34,780
- 你说什么 - 我的意思是
- Excuse me? - I'm just saying...

693
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:38,780
也许你老婆想知道 你的钱究竟是怎么来的
maybe your wife would like to know where you really get your money from.

694
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,200
- 你知道吗 - 怎么了
- You know what? - What?

695
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,750
你说得对
You're right.

696
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:44,370
- 这东西能用吗 - 我不知道
- That work? - I don't know.

697
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,210
我确实承受不起
I can't afford that.

698
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,920
等一下
Wait.

699
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,050
该死
Damn.

700
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,020
- 我还以为这是抗重力机枪 - 什么
- I thought this was the antigravity gun. - What?

701
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,270
不 是那把
No, that's that one.

702
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,780
给你
Here.

703
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,950
现在你是震撼者 你去把他弄丢的那些武器找回来
Now you're the Shocker. Go out there and find that weapon he lost.

704
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,160
没问题
All right.

705
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:36,380
谢谢你丢下我跑了
Hey, thanks for bailing on me.

706
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:38,510
我当时有急事
Yeah, well, something came up.

707
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,890
这是什么
What is that?

708
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,850
不知道 有人想要用它让我蒸发掉
I don't know. Some guy tried to vaporize me with it.

709
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,480
- 真的吗 - 真的
- Seriously? - Yeah.

710
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,100
太牛了
Awesome.

711
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:49,360
我不是说那人牛 那人简直是小人
I mean, not awesome. Totally uncool of that guy.

712
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,320
好恐怖啊
So scary.

713
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:54,320
我感觉这是个
Well, look, I think it's...

714
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:55,940
能量源
a power source.

715
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,700
是啊 但上面连着好多微处理器
Yeah, but it's connected to all these microprocessors.

716
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:02,080
这是块感应充电板 我的牙刷就是这么充电的
That's an inductive charging plate. That's what I use to charge my toothbrush.

717
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,290
制造武器的人同时运用了外星技术和人类技术
Whoever's making these weapons is combining alien tech with ours.

718
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:09,330
你刚才说的那句话简直不要太酷
That is literally the coolest sentence anyone has ever said.

719
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,540
我就是想谢谢你让我加入
I just want to thank you for letting me be part of your journey...

720
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:15,090
这段奇幻旅程...
into this amazing...

721
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,720
手指不要碰到刀片
Keep your fingers clear of the blades.

722
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,970
我一定要弄清楚这玩意儿是什么 还有是谁造的
I gotta figure out what this is and who makes it.

723
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,350
下课后我们去实验室做几个实验
We'll go to the lab after class and run tests.

724
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,810
开干吧
Let's do it.

725
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,570
首先 我们要把这个发光的东西放到质谱仪里

探测器说这里有能量脉冲

But how are you gonna get there if it's, like, 300 miles away?

那里离华盛顿特区不远
It's not too far from D.C.

哈皮 我必须要说 未经同意擅自追踪我
Happy, I gotta say, tracking me without permission...

788
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,610
是对我个人隐私的侵犯

- 那不一样 - 什么不一样

彼得
Peter...

798
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:51,820
我们为什么要把追踪器从你的战服里拿掉
why are we removing the tracker from your suit?

799
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:56,450
因为我必须在这些人再次转移之前 找到他们的头儿
I gotta follow these guys to their boss before they move again...

800
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:59,580
而且我不想让斯塔克先生知道
and I don't really want Mr. Stark to know about it.

801
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:01,580
这么说你在骗钢铁侠
So you're lying to Iron Man now?

802
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:03,380
不 我没在骗他
No, I'm not lying.

803
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:06,170
他只是不明白 我现在能做的事情很多
He just doesn't really get what I can do yet.

804
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,260

807
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:26,400
但都被《训练轮协议》禁用了
but they're all disabled by the Training Wheels Protocol.

808
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,690
怎么了
What?

809
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:31,490
"《训练轮协议》" 快关掉
"Training Wheels Protocol"? Turn it off.

810
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:34,580
我觉得这样不好 这些子系统之所以被禁用 是有原因的
I don't think that's a good idea. They're blocked for a reason.

811
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:37,330
拜托 伙计 我才不需要什么训练轮
Come on, man, I don't need training wheels.

I'm sick of him treating me like a kid all the time.

00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,330
- 一点儿都不酷 - 但你就是个孩子啊

00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,590
一个可以徒手拦住公共汽车的孩子
A kid who can stop a bus with his bare hands.

815
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:48,510
彼得 我就是觉得这主意不好 万一这么做违法呢
Peter, I just don't think this is a great idea. I mean, what if this is illegal?

816
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:51,630
听着 拜托了 这是我证明自己的机会
Look, please. This is my chance to prove myself.

822
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:20,000

And besides...

831
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:46,940
比赛前大家一起放纵一下 有助于提高士气
a rebellious group activity the day before competition is good for morale.

832
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,480
这是我从TED演讲里听来的 所以...

Besides, we raided the minibar and these candy bars were, like, $11.

刚才到底是怎么回事

00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:15,210
你从标志那里跳了下去 摔了个狗吃屎
You jumped off the sign and landed on your face.

我的射网器怎么用不了了

速射是增强版战斗模式的默认发射模式

你们两个在这儿等着
You two wait right here.

882
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:33,150
等下 你还是打开减震器比较好
Wait. You're gonna want to turn on the dampers.

883
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:35,000
不然那东西会把你胳膊震掉
That thing will shatter your arm.

00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,000
电击网 我不要电击网
Taser webs? I don't want Taser webs.

891
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:53,670
你貌似并不了解射网器的设置
You seem to be unfamiliar with your web-shooter settings.

892
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:55,880
要不要复习一下
Would you like to run a refresher course?

893

899
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,780

905
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:05,360
好了 我上去了
All right, coming up.

906
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:12,830
嗨 鸟人 这不是你的东西
Hey, Big Bird. This doesn't belong to you.

907
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,620
天呐
Oh, God.

908
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:24,930
- 制服女士 怎么回事 - 是你让我选的
- Suit lady, what was that?! - You told me to choose.

909
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:28,470
什么 不要 一切恢复正常状态
What? No, just set everything back to normal.

910
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:30,890
启动所有系统

我不知道
I'm not sure.

915

集装箱四壁挡住了传感器的信号
The container walls are hindering my sensors.

916
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,210
稍等
Wait a minute.

917
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:07,930
他们肯定是劫持了卡车 要把我带去他们的邪恶老巢
They must have hijacked the truck and taken me to their evil lair.

918

好的 制服女士 我们得想办法出去
Okay, suit lady, we're gonna have to fight our way out of this one.

大门明早才会有人打开
The door will most likely remain closed until morning.

00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,250
明天早上
Morning?

927
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:43,500
嗨 制服女士 我感觉叫你"制服女士"挺不礼貌的
Hey, suit lady. I kind of feel bad calling you "suit lady," you know?

928
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:45,960
我应该给你起个名字
I think I should probably give you a name.

929
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:48,470
比如说莉兹 不 不行
Like Liz. No, no, no.

930

莉兹是谁

而且...
And...

945
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:30,590
是的 我真的很想告诉她 但那么做的话有点怪怪的 你懂吗
Yeah, I just... I really want to tell her, but it's kind of weird, you know?

946
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:33,970
"嗨 我是蜘蛛侠"
"Hey, I'm Spider-Man."

947
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,260
这有什么奇怪的
What's weird about that?

948
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:37,470
万一她期待的是托尼·斯塔克呢
What if she's expecting someone like Tony Stark?

949
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,640
试想一下 如果她看到是我 心里该有多失望
Imagine how disappointed she'd be when she sees me.

950

如果我是她的话 一点儿都不会失望
Well, if I were her, I wouldn't be disappointed at all.

00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,020
谢了 凯伦
Thanks, Karen.

It's really nice to have somebody to talk to.

953
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:49,950
我们在这里多久了
Hey, how long we been here anyways?

954
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:51,990
- 37分钟 - 什么
- Thirty-seven minutes. -What?!

955
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,870
才37分钟 不是吧
Thirty-seven minutes? That's insane.

956
00:56:54,030 --> 00:56:57,700
我受不了了 我一定...一定要想个办法出去
I cannot take this anymore. I got to... I gotta get out of here.

这里肯定有能用得上的东西
There's got to be something in here I can use.

你手里那个发光的东西 是一个齐塔瑞爆炸能量核
That glowy thing is an explosive Chitauri energy core.

963
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,770
你是说我们一直背着一个炸弹跑来跑去
You mean, we've been carrying around a bomb?

964
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:21,640
它只有受到辐射时才会爆炸
It would require radiation to transform it into an explosive state.

965
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,480
不 不 不
No, no, no.

00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,120
奈德 赶紧打过来 那个发光体是个炸弹

弗拉什 你一个问题都没答

别担心 它很安全 在我背包里

1013
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:52,750
能让我告诉彼得他被驱逐出团队了吗

1014
00:59:56,970 --> 01:00:02,720
华盛顿纪念碑有555英尺 五右八分之一英寸高
The Washington Monument is 555 feet, five and one-eighth inches tall.

1015
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:07,480

齐塔瑞核已经分解

01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,690
我知道大家都很害怕 但我们的安全系统在运行中

1028
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:52,270
安全系统完全失效

- 上来 - 把你的手给我

距离灾难性故障发生还有125秒
You now have 125 seconds until catastrophic failure.

1034
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,080
什么 为什么

1035
01:01:14,590 --> 01:01:17,590
能量核突然位移 导致转化速度加快

- 我要怎么进去 - 启动侦查无人机

我身上一直戴着这东西吗 太棒了

1038
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:28,680

我只是从未到过这么高的地方
I've just never been this high before.

1048
01:02:07,470 --> 01:02:09,640
你还没有重新设置降落伞系统
You have also not reinstalled your parachute...

1049
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:12,520
不小心从这个高度摔下去很可能会致命

真会挑时候

1051
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:17,360
我的天
Oh, my God.

这玻璃怎么就不碎呢
Why is it not breaking?

1053
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:23,860
这是厚度约为四英寸的防弹玻璃 你得制造更大的冲力
It's four-inch ballistic glass. You'll have to create more momentum.

1054
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:45,430
我们是华盛顿警察 表明你的身份
This is D.C. Metro Police. Identify yourself.

1067
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:26,430
我要死了
I'm gonna die.

01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:36,180
碎吧
Break!

1069
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:51,990
我成功了
I did it.

1070
01:04:05,590 --> 01:04:07,550
嘿 你们还好吗 别担心 我来救你们了
Hey, how you doing? Don't worry. I got you.

1071

- 大块头 别乱动 - 抱歉 先生
- Big guy, quit moving around. - I'm sorry, sir.

1073
01:04:16,430 --> 01:04:17,480
快点 我们走了
Let's go, let's go!

1074
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:24,400
好了 可以了
Okay, okay.

1075
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:26,530
- 哈灵顿先生 快出去 - 跟上 奈德

- 你确定这安全吗 - 莉兹
- Are you sure it's safe? - Liz.

1079

莉兹
Liz!

1080
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:41,250

1083
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:50,010
使劲往上拉 加油 你们几个 往后退
Come on up. Come on, you guys, stay back.

1084
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:52,180
- 拉上来了 - 你们没事吧

你真的是彼得·帕克的朋友

1090
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:22,000
我可以完成下一个订单 但没有那辆卡车里的新材料...
I can finish the next order, but without any new materials from that truck....

1091
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:24,750
是啊 真该死
Yeah, damn it.

1092
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:27,490
但我们手里的材料还足够完成加尔冈的订单 对吗
We still have enough to do the Gargan deal though, right?

1093
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:29,630
是的 但之后的订单就做不成了
Yeah, but then that's it.

1094
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:35,850
不如我还是继续打造高海拔真空密封器吧
Maybe it is time that I built the high-altitude seal.

1095
01:05:36,010 --> 01:05:37,740
- 你能不能闭上嘴 别说这事了 - 我们只能做这个了
- Would you shut up about that? - It's only one job.

1096
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:39,270
不
No.

1097
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:44,020
八年了 那些联邦工作人员 丝毫没有察觉
Eight years, not a word from the feds, nothing from those...

1098
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:48,230
斯塔克大厦里那些一副万圣节打扮的傻蛋们也是一样
Halloween-costume-wearing bozos up there in Stark Tower.

1099
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:53,110
然后突然之间不知从哪冒出来一个穿着红色紧身衣的小混蛋
And then all of a sudden, this little bastard in red tights shows up.

1100
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:56,950
妄想能毁掉我创造的一切
And he thinks he can tear down everything I've built.

1101
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:00,000
真的吗
Really?

1102
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:02,330
我要宰了他
I'm gonna kill him.

1103
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,540
- 我会找到他... - 我找到他了
- I'm gonna find him... - Found him.

1104
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:06,000
蜘蛛侠从天而降
The Spider-Man swooped in...

1105
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:09,090
英勇地救下了一支来自皇后区的参赛队伍

1106
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:12,470
这位戴面具的英雄仍旧身份不明
The identity of the masked hero is still unknown.

1107
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:17,470
- 妈妈 - 孩子们 没事了

1108
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,140
彼得 过来 快过来
Peter. Come here, come here, come here.

1109
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:26,560
上周末 来自中城的学术十项全能队伍

击败了全国头号种子队伍 赢得了全国冠军
defeated the country's best to win the national championship.

1111
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:31,530
就在那一天的晚些时候 他们也击败了死亡
Later that day, they also defeated death.

1112
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:34,110
突如其来的爆炸 萨利在尖叫 弗拉什在尖叫 大家都在尖叫
Explosion. Sally scream. Flash scream. Everybody screaming.

1113
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:38,080
当时到处是紫色的激光和烟雾 气氛超紧张 就像邦乔维乐队的音乐会
There were purple lasers and smoke. It was **** tight, like a Bon Jovi concert.

1114
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:41,620
如你所知 我们成功逃出生天 这点是最重要的
As you know, we made it out alive, and that's the important thing.

1115
01:06:41,790 --> 01:06:44,870
我承受不了在学校组织的旅行中失去哪怕一个学生
I couldn't bear to lose a student on a school trip.

1116
01:06:46,130 --> 01:06:47,170
这事不能再次发生
Not again.

1117
01:06:47,330 --> 01:06:51,050
幸亏有蜘蛛侠 没人受到严重伤害 我对此满怀感激
Thankfully, no one was seriously injured thanks to the Spider-Man.

1118
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:53,590
- 谢谢你 蜘蛛侠 - 谢谢你 蜘蛛侠
- Thank you, Spider-Man. - Thank you, Spider-Man.

如何彰显你的蜘蛛侠精神
How can you show your spider spirit?

1121
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:05,190
哥们 哥们
Dude, dude, dude.

1122
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:08,060
你火了 但没人知道火的人就是你 这感觉如何
What is it like being famous when nobody knows it's you?

1123
01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:09,690
- 棒极了 伙计 - 棒极了
- Crazy, dude. - It's crazy.

1124
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:11,690
- 我们该把真相告诉大家吗 - 不行
- Should we tell everyone? - No.

1125
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:14,650
- 我该把真相告诉大家吗 - 不行 哥们 这主意不好
- Should I tell everyone? - No, dude. That's not a good idea.

1126
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:18,160
- 好了 走吧 我们上课要迟到了 - 我不打算去上课
- Okay, come on, we'll be late to class. - I'm not going to class.

1127
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:20,220
你逃掉十项全能比赛 已经给人惹上麻烦了
You're already in trouble for ditching the decathlon.

1128
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:21,790
哥们 听着 我会解决好的
Dude, listen, I figured it out.

1129
01:07:21,950 --> 01:07:23,870
那个穿着飞行服的家伙 从损害控制部门那里偷东西
The wingsuit guy is stealing from Damage Control.

1130
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:27,040
他从损害控制部门那里偷来的东西 让他制造出了那些武器
What he takes from Damage Control, that's how he builds the weapons.

1131
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:30,130
- 所以我要做的就是抓住他 - 但我们还有个西语随堂测验
- So all I gotta do is catch him. - But we have a Spanish quiz.

1132
01:07:30,290 --> 01:07:32,500
奈德 我大概永远都不会回学校了
Ned, I'm probably never gonna come back here.

1133
01:07:32,670 --> 01:07:35,720
斯塔克先生要招新人加入复仇者联盟
Mr. Stark is moving the Avengers upstate...

1134
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:37,840
- 当我抓住那个家伙交给他的时候... - 哥们
- so when I bring this guy in... - Dude.

1135
01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:39,930
你想高中就辍学
You want to be a high school dropout?

1136
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:42,770
我现在的能力已经远远超出高中水平了
I am so far beyond high school right now.

1137
01:07:42,930 --> 01:07:45,640
帕克 到我办公室来
Parker, my office.

1138
01:07:48,310 --> 01:07:49,940
看来
So...

1139
01:07:50,110 --> 01:07:51,610
你被留堂了
you got detention.

1140
01:07:51,770 --> 01:07:53,940
你做了错事 也清楚你做了错事
You screwed up. You know what you did was wrong.

1141
01:07:54,110 --> 01:07:56,490
问题是你打算如何弥补自己的错误
The question is, how are you gonna make things right?

1142
01:07:56,650 --> 01:07:57,970
也许你当时只是想扮酷
Maybe you were trying to be cool.

1143
01:07:58,530 --> 01:08:01,200
但是请听我这个扮酷到在冰里冻了65年的人一言
But take it from a guy who's been frozen for 65 years...

1144
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:04,500
扮酷的唯一办法就是遵守规则
the only way to really be cool is to follow the rules.

1145
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:08,120
我们都知道什么是对的 什么是错的
We all know what's right. We all know what's wrong.

1146
01:08:08,290 --> 01:08:10,830
下回那些弱智再想怂恿你去做一些
Next time those turkeys try to convince you of something...

1147
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,280
- 你明知是错的事 - 你要去哪 回来
- you know is wrong... - Where you going? Get back here.

1148
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:15,800
自己先好好自忖一下 美国队长会怎么做
just think to yourself, what would Captain America do?

1149
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:17,760
你怎么在这 你又没被留堂
Why are you here? You don't have detention.

怎么回事
What the hell?

1286
01:18:45,090 --> 01:18:46,800
嗨 蜘蛛侠
Hi, Spider-Man.

1287
01:18:46,970 --> 01:18:49,350
这就是你的乐队练习 是吧
Band practice, was it?

1288
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,210
好耶 钢铁侠
Yeah, Iron Man!

1289
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,380
斯塔克先生
Mr. Stark.

1290
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:27,390
嘿 斯塔克先生 我能做什么吗 你想要我做什么
Hey, Mr. Stark, could I do anything? What do you want me to do?

1291
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:30,430
我觉得你做得够多了
I think you've done enough.

1292
01:19:44,570 --> 01:19:47,820
所以就这样了 你打算就这么逃跑
So that's it. You're just gonna run?

1293
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,660
联邦调查局在那里守株待兔
Feds were waiting for us.

1294
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:55,500
现在我们都在钢铁侠的雷达上了
Now we're on Iron Man's radar?

1295
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:57,920
没错 我要逃跑了
Yeah, I'm running.

1296
01:19:58,710 --> 01:19:59,880
你也该逃跑
You should too.

1297
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:02,250
你知道我不能那么做
You know I can't do that.

1298
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:03,630
那你现在打算怎么办
So now what?

1299
01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:08,760
梅森 你能造那个高海拔真空密封器 让它按时运转吗
Mason, can you get that high-altitude seal thing up and running in time?

1300
01:20:09,550 --> 01:20:10,930
你说真的
Seriously?

1301
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:13,270
好的 你不会后悔的
Yes. You will not regret this.

1302
01:20:16,730 --> 01:20:18,230
你加入吗
You in?

1303
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:30,950
上回你闯了祸时
Previously on Peter Screws the Pooch...

1304
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:32,830
我就告诉你别再这么做了
I tell you to stay away from this.

1305
01:20:32,990 --> 01:20:35,620
你反而黑了一件价值数百万美元的装备
Instead, you hacked a multimillion-dollar suit...

1306
01:20:35,790 --> 01:20:38,040
这样你就能背着我
so you could sneak around behind my back...

1307
01:20:38,210 --> 01:20:41,040
去做唯一那件我告诉你不要做的事
doing the one thing I told you not to do.

1308
01:20:41,210 --> 01:20:42,210
大家都没事吧
Is everyone okay?

1309
01:20:43,090 --> 01:20:45,590
这也不是你的功劳
No thanks to you.

1310
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:48,380
不是我的功劳
No thanks to me?

1311
01:20:49,930 --> 01:20:52,550
有人在销售那些危险武器 我试着告诉你这件事
Those weapons were out there, and I tried to tell you about it...

1312
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:54,100
但你不听
but you didn't listen.

1313
01:20:54,260 --> 01:20:57,690
要是你当初听了我的话 这些事就不会发生了
None of this would've happened if you had just listened to me.

1314
01:20:57,850 --> 01:20:59,900
要是你哪怕有一点点关心 你就会亲自到这里来
If you even cared, you'd actually be here.

1315
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:07,530
我当然听了 孩子 你以为联邦调查局是谁叫来的
I did listen, kid. Who do you think called the FBI, huh?

1316
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:10,280
你知不知道我是唯一一个信任你的人
Do you know I was the only one who believed in you?

1317
01:21:10,450 --> 01:21:14,240
其他所有人都觉得我是疯了 才会招收一个14岁的小孩
Everyone else said I was crazy to recruit a 14-year-old kid.

1318
01:21:14,410 --> 01:21:16,700
- 我15岁了 - 你这时闭嘴就好 明白吗
- I'm 15. - No, this is where you zip it, all right?

1319
01:21:16,870 --> 01:21:19,460
大人在说话 小孩别插嘴 要是今晚有人死掉怎么办
The adult is talking. What if somebody had died tonight?

1320
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:22,710
一切就不同了 不是吗 因为那会是你的错
Different story, right? Because that's on you.

1321
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:24,210
而要是你死了
And if you died...

1322
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:26,590
我会觉得那是我的错
I feel like that's on me.

1323
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:28,840
- 我不需要背上这种良心债 - 是的 先生
- I don't need that on my conscience. - Yes, sir.

1324
01:21:28,970 --> 01:21:31,590
- 我很抱歉 我明白 - 道歉没用
- I'm sorry. I understand. - Sorry doesn't cut it.

1325
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:34,140
我只是想像你一样
I just wanted to be like you.

1326
01:21:34,300 --> 01:21:35,850
而我想要你比我更好
And I wanted you to be better.

1327
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,980
这行不通 我要收回这身装备
It's not working out. I'm gonna need the suit back.

1328
01:21:40,140 --> 01:21:42,350
- 什么时候再给我 - 永远不给
- For how long? - Forever.

1329
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:44,570
- 就是这样 - 不 不要 求你
- Yeah, that's how it works. - No, no. Please.

1330
01:21:44,730 --> 01:21:46,650
- 把它给我 - 求你 我只有这个了
- Let's have it. - Please, this is all I have.

1331
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:48,190
没有这身装备 我什么也不是
I'm nothing without this suit.

1332
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:51,460
如果没了这身装备你什么也不是 那你就不该拥有它
If you're nothing without this suit, then you shouldn't have it.

1333
01:21:51,530 --> 01:21:52,700
明白吗
Okay?

1334
01:21:52,870 --> 01:21:55,080
天啊 我听起来跟我爸一样
God, I sound like my dad.

1335
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,000
我没带其他衣服
I don't have any other clothes.

1336
01:21:59,660 --> 01:22:01,670
好吧 我们会解决这个问题的
Okay, we'll sort that out.

1337
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,220
嗨
Hey.

1338
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:21,350
我这一整天一直给你打电话 但你就是不接
I've been calling you all day. You didn't answer your phone.

1339
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:22,980
你不能这么做
You can't do that.

1340
01:22:23,150 --> 01:22:25,770
然后发生了这个渡轮事故
Then this ferry thing happens.

1341
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:28,610
我给五个警察局打了电话
I've called five police stations.

1342
01:22:28,780 --> 01:22:29,990
五个警察局
Five.

1343
01:22:30,150 --> 01:22:32,090
我给你的五个朋友打了电话 也给奈德的妈妈打了电话
I called five of your friends. I called Ned's mother.

1344
01:22:32,110 --> 01:22:35,740
我没事 梅婶 我很好 真的 放松点 我没事
I'm fine. May, I'm okay. Honestly, just relax. I'm fine.

1345
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:37,700
少说废话
Cut the bullshit.

1346
01:22:37,870 --> 01:22:39,540
我知道你被留堂了
I know you left detention.

1347
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:42,210
我知道在华盛顿时你离开了酒店房间
I know you left the hotel room in Washington.

1348
01:22:42,370 --> 01:22:44,290
我知道你每晚都从家里偷溜出去
I know you sneak out of this house every night.

1349
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:45,750
这不是没事
That's not fine.

1350
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:49,550
彼得 你必须告诉我发生了什么事 告诉我吧
Peter, you have to tell me what's going on. Just lay it out.

1351
01:22:49,710 --> 01:22:50,760
这里只有我和你
It's just me and you.

1352
01:22:52,630 --> 01:22:54,260
我失去了去斯塔克公司实习的机会
I lost the Stark internship.

1353
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:56,430
- 什么 - 是的
- What? - Yeah.

1354
01:22:56,890 --> 01:22:58,010
发生了什么事
What happened?

1355
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:02,640
我以为我能很努力 而他会... 他会愿意... 你懂的
I just thought that I could work really hard and he could... He would... You know.

1356
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:05,940
但我搞砸了
But I screwed it up.

1357
01:23:06,110 --> 01:23:07,900
没事的
It's okay, it's okay.

1358
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:11,240
没关系的
It's okay.

1359
01:23:12,110 --> 01:23:14,530
我很抱歉我让你担心了
I'm sorry I made you worry.

1360
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:16,530
我没想毁掉你的生活
I'm not trying to ruin your life.

1361
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:17,990
嗯 我知道
Yeah, I know.

1362
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:19,450
我只是...
Just...

1363
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:22,000
- 我以前也从家里偷溜出去过 - 是啊
- I used to sneak out too. - Yeah.

1364
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,170
去洗个澡 你身上臭死了
And take a shower. You smell.

1365
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:30,210
臭得像从垃圾堆里钻出来似的
You smell like garbage.

1366
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:32,010
我知道
I know.

1367
01:23:35,050 --> 01:23:37,390
彼得 你是个好孩子 也是个聪明的孩子
Peter, you're a good kid and you're a smart kid...

1368
01:23:37,550 --> 01:23:40,180
努力向前看 明白吗
so just try to keep your head straight, okay?

1369
01:23:40,810 --> 01:23:42,270
好的
Okay.

1370
01:23:42,430 --> 01:23:44,270
好了 出去吧
All right, get out of here.

1371
01:23:52,150 --> 01:23:53,280
你被开除了
Are you expelled?

1372
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:56,450
你得去那个校长有十字弓的高中上学了
Do you have to go to that high school where the principal has a crossbow?

1373
01:23:56,610 --> 01:23:59,950
我很肯定这是个城市传说 还有 我没被开除
Pretty sure that's an urban myth, and, no, I'm not expelled.

1374
01:24:00,490 --> 01:24:02,790
你可真走运
You're so lucky.

1375
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,550
答的不错 帕克先生
Muy bueno, se?or Parker.

1376
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:51,200
嗨
Hey.

1377
01:24:52,460 --> 01:24:53,000
嘿
Hey.

1378
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:55,590
我以为你第五节课是微积分
I thought you had calculus fifth period.

1379
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:58,130
我在做校友返校日的材料
Yeah, I was just doing some homecoming stuff.

1380
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:00,010
嘿 听着 我...
Hey, look, I...

1381
01:25:00,890 --> 01:25:03,600
我想为比赛的事向你道歉
I just wanted to apologize about the whole decathlon thing.

1382
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:04,850
没关系
It's fine.

1383
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:09,060
上周 十项全能是最重要的事 但之后我差点死了
Last week, decathlon was the most important thing, but then I almost died.

1384
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:11,150
不 我...
No, I'm...

1385
01:25:11,310 --> 01:25:13,320
我是说...
I just mean that...

1386
01:25:13,820 --> 01:25:16,360
我做得不对 尤其是...
it was not cool, especially...

1387
01:25:18,110 --> 01:25:19,860
因为...
because...

1388
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:23,700
我喜欢你
I like you.

1389
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:25,700
我知道
I know.

1390
01:25:28,330 --> 01:25:29,370
你知道
You do?

1391
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:32,170
你根本藏不住秘密
You're terrible at keeping secrets.

1392
01:25:32,330 --> 01:25:34,000
那你绝对会大吃一惊的
Yeah, you'd be surprised.

1393
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:39,680
我得去上课了 但...
I got to get to class, but...

1394
01:25:40,090 --> 01:25:44,260
我本想说我们该一起出去玩 但我会被...
I'd say we should hang out, but I'm gonna be in detention...

1395
01:25:44,430 --> 01:25:47,430
永远留堂 但是...
forever, but...

1396
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,940
我猜你在返校日那天肯定已经有约了
I guess you already have a date to homecoming.

1397
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:54,820
其实 我是忙着构思这个活动 还没时间去找伴儿 所以...
Actually, I was so busy planning it, I never really got around to that part, so...

1398
01:25:56,030 --> 01:25:57,740
那你愿意
Do you want to...

1399
01:25:57,900 --> 01:25:58,940
和我一起参加吗
go with me?

1400
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:01,740
好啊 我很乐意
Yeah. Sure.

1401
01:26:01,910 --> 01:26:04,530
真的 我是说 棒极了 好啊
Really? I mean, great. Cool.

1402
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:06,330
好啊
Cool.

1403
01:26:06,830 --> 01:26:09,410
其实我要走这边
I'm actually going that way.

1404
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:22,470
梅婶婶 我需要你的帮助
May, I need your help.

1405
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:40,740
穿过去或绕一圈
Through or around?

1406
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:46,990
好了
Right?

1407
01:26:57,340 --> 01:26:59,590
今天要约会了 你有什么计划
It's game day. So, what's the plan?

1408
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:01,300
给她开门
Open the door for her.

1409
01:27:01,470 --> 01:27:03,990
告诉她她看起来很美 但不能过分恭维 因为这会很瘆人
Tell her she looks nice, but not too much because that's creepy.

1410
01:27:04,050 --> 01:27:05,140
- 不能让人觉得你瘆得慌 - 是的
- Don't be creepy. - No.

1411
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:07,970
和她跳舞时 我要把手放在她的胯部
When I dance with her, I'm putting my hands on her hips.

1412
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:09,890
没问题
I got this.

1413
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:13,350
- 我爱你 - 再见
- Love you. - Bye.

1414
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:29,870
你肯定就是彼得
You must be Peter.

1415
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:31,830
没错
Yeah.

1416
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,540
我是莉兹的爸爸
I'm Liz's dad.

1417
01:27:33,710 --> 01:27:35,210
握个手吧
Put her there.

1418
01:27:35,790 --> 01:27:37,330
挺有劲啊
Hell of a grip.

1419
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:39,800
进来吧 来吧
Come on in here. Come on.

1420
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:04,570
嗨 彼得
Hi, Peter.

1421
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:06,820
你看起来真帅
You look very handsome.

1422
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:08,490
谢谢
Thank you.

1423
01:28:08,660 --> 01:28:10,780
你叫对他的名字了
You got his name right?

1424
01:28:10,950 --> 01:28:12,330
- 弗雷迪 - 是彼得
- Freddie? - Peter.

1425
01:28:12,490 --> 01:28:13,700
彼得 彼得
Peter. Peter.

1426
01:28:14,710 --> 01:28:15,830
我去叫莉兹
I'm gonna go get Liz.

1427
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:17,790
好的
Okay.

1428
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:24,970
你还好吧 彼得
You all right, Pete?

1429
01:28:25,130 --> 01:28:26,260
挺好的
Yeah.

1430
01:28:26,630 --> 01:28:29,010
你的脸色看起来很苍白
Because you look pale.

1431
01:28:30,850 --> 01:28:32,310
你想喝些什么吗
You want something to drink?

1432

但按照惯例现在拿出来给大家看一下是 激励大家再接再厉
but just for motivation right now at this practice.

1724
01:56:14,220 --> 01:56:17,600
我现在是身具优势 但明年我们将需要一个新队长
I'm ahead of the game, but we will need a new team captain next year.

1725
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:20,430
我要任命米歇尔为新队长
So I am appointing Michelle.

1726
01:56:21,430 --> 01:56:23,100
好耶
Yeah!

1727
01:56:25,310 --> 01:56:26,520
谢谢
Thank you.

1728
01:56:26,690 --> 01:56:28,150
我...我朋友都叫我MJ
My... My friends call me MJ.

1729
01:56:28,770 --> 01:56:30,820
我以为你没有朋友
I thought you didn't have any friends.

1730
01:56:30,980 --> 01:56:32,900
我是没有
I didn't.

1731
01:56:37,780 --> 01:56:39,790
- 我先走了 - 嘿 你要去哪
- I gotta go. - Hey, where you going?

1732
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:44,620
你在隐藏什么 彼得
What are you hiding, Peter?

1733
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:48,500
我只是在开玩笑 我才不在乎呢 再见
I'm just kidding. I don't care. Bye.

1734
01:56:48,670 --> 01:56:51,340
- 好了 我们该练习一下 - 没错
- All right, so we should run some drills. - Yeah.

1735
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:03,100
嘿 哈皮 你怎么... 你来这干嘛
Hey, Happy. What...? What are you doing here?

1736
01:57:04,060 --> 01:57:05,310
我欠你的
I really owe you one.

1737
01:57:07,400 --> 01:57:09,690
我不知道没了这份工作我该怎么办
I don't know what I would do without this job.

1738
01:57:09,860 --> 01:57:12,360
我是在 在我遇到托尼之前...
I mean, before I met Tony...

1739
01:57:41,470 --> 01:57:43,470
你在这呆了多久了
So how long you been here?

1740
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:45,810
久到让人尴尬的地步 老板想见你
Long enough to be awkward. Boss wants to see you.

1741
01:57:46,770 --> 01:57:49,650
- 他也来了 - 在蹲马桶吗 不 他在北部
- Is he here too? - In the toilet? No, he's upstate.

1742
01:57:50,190 --> 01:57:51,690
北部 你是说 那个北部吗
Upstate... Like, upstate-upstate?

1743
01:57:51,860 --> 01:57:53,440
是的 我们走吧
Yeah, let's go.

1744
01:57:54,820 --> 01:57:55,940
瞧瞧
Take a look.

1745
01:57:56,110 --> 01:57:58,160
相当不错 不是吗
It's pretty impressive, huh?

1746
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:01,990
他们刚刚改建完整个建筑
They just finished remodeling the whole thing.

1747
01:58:28,190 --> 01:58:31,270
- 这可不是天天都能看到的 - 你们到了啊
- You don't see that every day. - Oh, there they are.

1748
01:58:31,940 --> 01:58:33,570
来的路上顺利吗
How was the ride up?

1749
01:58:33,980 --> 01:58:36,610
- 很好 - 让我和这孩子单独聊两分钟
- Good. - Give me a minute with the kid.

1750
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:39,200
- 真的吗 - 真的
- Seriously? - Yeah.

1751
01:58:39,610 --> 01:58:40,990
我得和这孩子谈谈
I gotta talk to the kid.

1752
01:58:41,570 --> 01:58:42,660
我会紧跟在后面
I'll be close behind.

1753
01:58:42,830 --> 01:58:46,580
跟远一点怎么样 好吗 保持距离也是件好事
How about a loose follow? All right? Boundaries are good.

1754
01:58:51,580 --> 01:58:52,790
抱歉我拿走了你的装备
Sorry I took your suit.

1755
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:55,460
你早猜到了吧 其实 事实证明
You had it coming. Actually, it turns out it was...

1756
01:58:55,630 --> 01:58:57,630
那正是你所需要的严爱时刻
the perfect tough-love moment that you needed.

1757
01:58:57,800 --> 01:59:00,630
为了督促你前进 不是吗 你不这么想 你不这么认为
To urge you on, right? Wouldn't you think? Don't you think?

1758
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:02,590
- 我猜是吧 - 说是就行了
- I guess. - Let's just say it was.

1759
01:59:04,470 --> 01:59:07,680
- 斯塔克先生 我真的... - 你犯过大错 很严重的大错
- Mr. Stark, I really... - You screwed the pooch hard, bigtime.

1760
01:59:08,310 --> 01:59:09,980
但之后你做了正确的事
But then you did the right thing.

1761
01:59:10,140 --> 01:59:13,310
带那只狗去了免费诊所 你养大了那只杂种狗...
Took the dog to the free clinic, you raised the hybrid puppies....

1762
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:15,360
好吧 我这类比用得不算最好
All right, not my best analogy.

1763
01:59:16,570 --> 01:59:18,490
我误解了你
I was wrong about you.

1764
01:59:19,030 --> 01:59:21,280
我觉得 只要稍加指导
I think, with a little more mentoring...

1765
01:59:21,450 --> 01:59:23,910
你会真正融入这支队伍
you could be a real asset to the team.

1766
01:59:25,700 --> 01:59:27,540
- 融入...这支队伍 - 是啊 总而言之...
- To the...? To the team? - Yeah. Anyway...

1767
01:59:27,700 --> 01:59:30,750
那扇门后有大约五十名记者 真正的记者 不是博主
there's about 50 reporters behind that door. Real ones, not bloggers.

1768
01:59:31,250 --> 01:59:33,080
如果你准备好了
When you're ready...

1769
01:59:33,460 --> 01:59:35,170
何不试试这身装备
why don't you try that on?

1770
01:59:35,340 --> 01:59:39,260
我将向全世界隆重介绍 复仇者联盟最新正式成员
And I'll introduce the world to the newest official member of the Avengers:

1771
01:59:39,420 --> 01:59:41,090
蜘蛛侠
Spider-Man.

1772
01:59:43,550 --> 01:59:45,140
我...
I....

1773
01:59:46,810 --> 01:59:49,060
好好看看
Yeah, give that a look.

1774
01:59:54,560 --> 01:59:56,880
新闻发布会之后 哈皮会带你去看你的房间
After the press conference, Happy will show you to your room...

1775
01:59:56,900 --> 01:59:57,980
也就是你的新住处
your new quarters.

1776
01:59:58,150 --> 02:00:00,400
他的房间在哪里 挨着幻视
Where's he between? He's next to Vision?

1777
02:00:00,570 --> 02:00:02,820
- 是的 幻视不喜欢门 - 这可真有趣
- Yeah, Vision's not big on doors. - It's fun.

1778
02:00:02,990 --> 02:00:04,320
他也不喜欢墙
Or walls.

1779
02:00:04,490 --> 02:00:06,370
你会适应这里的
You'll fit right in.

1780
02:00:12,790 --> 02:00:14,790
谢谢你 斯塔克先生
Thank you, Mr. Stark.

1781
02:00:15,250 --> 02:00:16,500
但我还是不加入你们了
But I'm good.

1782
02:00:17,540 --> 02:00:20,050
你不加入了 你怎么能不加入呢
You're good? Good...? How are you good?

1783
02:00:20,210 --> 02:00:24,390
我是说 我更愿意多当一段时间平凡人
Well, I mean, I'd rather just stay on the ground for a little while.

1784
02:00:24,550 --> 02:00:26,720
当个好邻居蜘蛛侠
Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.

1785
02:00:26,890 --> 02:00:28,970
总得有人保护弱者 不是吗
Somebody's got to look out for the little guy, right?

1786
02:00:29,310 --> 02:00:30,770
你这是在拒绝我
You're turning me down?

1787
02:00:30,930 --> 02:00:33,020
你最好好好考虑一下 看看那个
You better think about this. Look at that.

1788
02:00:33,190 --> 02:00:34,440
看看我
Look at me.

1789
02:00:35,190 --> 02:00:36,270
这是你最后的机会 同意还是拒绝
Last chance. Yes or no?

1790
02:00:36,440 --> 02:00:37,730
- 我拒绝 - 好吧
- No. - Okay.

1791
02:00:37,900 --> 02:00:41,400
这有点斯普林斯汀的工人阶级英雄范儿 我还是蛮欣赏的
It's kind of a Springsteen-y, working-class hero vibe that I dig.

1792
02:00:41,570 --> 02:00:43,570
哈皮会送你回家
Happy will take you home.

1793
02:00:43,740 --> 02:00:45,240
- 好吗 - 好的
- Yeah? - Yeah.

1794
02:00:45,410 --> 02:00:47,570
介意先去车里等一会吗 我等会就过去
Mind waiting in the car? I need a minute.

1795
02:00:49,120 --> 02:00:51,790
- 谢谢你 斯塔克先生 - 不客气 帕克先生
- Thank you, Mr. Stark. - Yes, Mr. Parker, very well.

1796
02:00:51,950 --> 02:00:53,660
- 回头见 - 好的
- See you around. - Okay.

1797
02:01:01,880 --> 02:01:03,090
这是个考验 对吗
That was a test, right?

1798
02:01:03,880 --> 02:01:06,340
- 那后面没人 对吧 - 是的 你通过了
- There's nobody back there? - Yes, you passed.

1799
02:01:07,220 --> 02:01:10,100
- 好了 赶紧溜吧 小伙子 - 谢谢 斯塔克先生
- All right, skedaddle there, young buck. - Thank you, Mr. Stark.

1800
02:01:10,260 --> 02:01:11,970
嗯 也谢谢你
Yeah, thank you.

1801
02:01:14,060 --> 02:01:15,940
我跟你说过他是个好孩子
Told you he's a good kid.

1802
02:01:22,190 --> 02:01:23,650
- 那个孩子呢 - 他走了
- Where's the kid? - He left.

1803
02:01:23,820 --> 02:01:26,740
- 大家都在等着呢 - 他其实做了个成熟的选择
- Everybody's waiting. - He actually made a mature choice.

1804
02:01:26,910 --> 02:01:29,910
- 这把我们都惊呆了 - 你把这事搞砸了
- It just surprised the heck out of us. - Did you screw this up?

1805
02:01:30,080 --> 02:01:32,300
- 是他告诉那孩子去车里等的 - 你在逗我吗
- He told the kid to go wait in the car. - Are you kidding?

1806
02:01:32,330 --> 02:01:34,500
我这里有一屋子的人等着
I have a room full of people in there waiting...

1807
02:01:34,660 --> 02:01:36,600
一个爆炸性的公告 我该告诉他们什么
for some big announcement. What will I tell them?

1808
02:01:36,620 --> 02:01:39,130
瞎编点什么 不如...
Think of something. How about...?

1809
02:01:39,670 --> 02:01:41,840
- 哈皮 你还带着那个戒指吗 - 我...
- Hap, you still got that ring? - Do I...? I...?

1810
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:43,320
- 那个订婚戒指 - 你是在逗我吗
- The engagement ring. - Are you kidding?

1811
02:01:43,340 --> 02:01:46,550
我自2008年起就一直随身带着它
I've been carrying this since 2008.

1812
02:01:49,220 --> 02:01:50,350
好的
Okay.

1813
02:01:50,510 --> 02:01:52,240
我想我能想个比这更好的办法
I think I can think of something better than that.

1814
02:01:52,260 --> 02:01:54,640
这会给我们争取些时间
Well, it would buy us a little time.

1815
02:01:55,930 --> 02:01:58,060
其实我们不太赶时间
Like we need time.

1816
02:01:58,230 --> 02:01:59,990
我真不敢相信你把这个装在口袋里
I can't believe you have that in your pocket.

1817
02:02:00,060 --> 02:02:02,570
- 要我给你开门吗 亲爱的 - 我自己来就好
- Want me to get the door for you, hon? - I got it.

1818
02:02:18,750 --> 02:02:21,210
梅婶 晚饭好了吗
Aunt May, did you do dinner already?

1819
02:02:31,470 --> 02:02:33,140
梅婶
May?

1820
02:02:54,910 --> 02:02:55,950
这什么鬼...
What the...?!

1821
02:05:10,050 --> 02:05:12,010
瞧瞧谁来了
Look who it is.

1822
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:17,090
你和我最终来到同一个"夏令营"的几率有多大
What are the odds you and I'd end up at the same summer camp?

1823
02:05:17,260 --> 02:05:18,550
放轻松
Relax.

1824
02:05:19,180 --> 02:05:21,180
这个 这不怪你
This? It's not on you.

1825
02:05:21,350 --> 02:05:24,440
这要怪我们那个小蜘蛛朋友
It's on our little spider friend.

1826
02:05:24,600 --> 02:05:28,190
我外面有些哥们想见见他
I've got some boys on the outside who would love to meet him.

1827
02:05:28,360 --> 02:05:31,820
照个相 割断他的喉咙 把他的脑袋放进烘干机里
You know, take a picture, slice his throat, put his head in a dryer.

1828
02:05:32,360 --> 02:05:34,610
我听到些传闻
And I heard a rumor.

1829
02:05:37,870 --> 02:05:39,450
你知道他是谁
You know who he is.

1830
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:45,540
如果我知道他是谁
If I knew who he was...

1831
02:05:45,710 --> 02:05:47,290
那他早就死了
he'd already be dead.

1832
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:54,720
图姆斯 你的家人来探监了
Toomes, your family's here!

1833
02:12:33,820 --> 02:12:36,660
嘿 我是美国队长 在此跟你们说说
Hi, I'm Captain America, here to talk to you...

1834
02:12:36,830 --> 02:12:40,790
一个士兵或学生最宝贵的品质之一
about one of the most valuable traits a soldier or student can have.

1835
02:12:40,950 --> 02:12:42,620
就是耐心
Patience.

1836
02:12:42,790 --> 02:12:44,920
有时耐心是成功的关键
Sometimes patience is the key to victory.

1837
02:12:45,080 --> 02:12:47,130
有时耐心会带来不理想的结果
Sometimes it leads to very little...

1838
02:12:47,290 --> 02:12:49,630
让它看起来很划不来
and it seems like it's not worth it.

1839
02:12:49,800 --> 02:12:51,300
你会怀疑
And you wonder...

1840
02:12:51,470 --> 02:12:55,300
为何等待了这么久 却只等到了令人如此失望的结果
why you waited so long for something so disappointing.

1841
02:12:59,010 --> 02:13:01,020
这种视频我还要录多少
How many more of these?

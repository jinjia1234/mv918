你那位所谓的魔术师在哪

这  这看起来就像世界末日一样

你所谓的魔术师梅林帮不了我们

他就是个不值一提的醉鬼
He's a worthless drunkard!

15

00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,400
最后一口

真的是走投无路了  我是认真的
End-of-times sort of thing. I mean it.

就在我们说话的这会儿  我的族人在浴血奋战
It's happening down there now as we speak.

34
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,070
相当糟糕
It's awful!

00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,770
刀光剑影的  杀的非常激烈
Big personalities just sort of clashing and bloody.

36
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,110
我实在难以启齿  但我们需要你的帮助

37

没有咒语  也没有魔法

我们撤退  择日再战

不行

好吧  我就和他们说的那样
All right, I am what they say!

我是个骗子  是个冒牌货  我这辈子都在坑蒙拐骗
I'm a liar, I'm a charlatan. I've deceived my whole life.

165
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,940
对你来说  他是我男朋友

总得有人照顾他们啊
Someone's gotta take care of 'em.

173

30秒就位  我要开火吗
On location 30 seconds. Am I cleared to fire?

No, place, no home, no family. Do you know how that feels?

- 起来  - 我不行了

快点  快点  没时间了  走

207
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,290

208
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,460

那个救变形金刚的人

210
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,060
我本认为你就是个传说
I thought you were just a legend.

00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,130
传说又怎样
Some legend.

212
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,190
- 你来得太迟了  - 走  走

228
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,560
这个护身符会保护你

你不欠我任何东西
You don't owe me anything.

230
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,390
古塞伯坦语
Seglass ni Tonday.

231
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:17,560
我不能拿  你留着吧
I can't. You keep it.

232
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,200
昆  昆
Quin... Quin...

233
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,470
他没挺过来  大黄蜂  我一个人出来了
He didn't make it, Bee. I'm coming out solo.

234
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,510
今天看来要变得更糟了
This is turning into one shitty-ass day.

235
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,580
独眼巨人  盯紧大鱼
Cyclops, eyeball Kingfish.

236

把红外线调成光电传感器

结束了  帮你自己一把吧
It's over. Help yourself out here.

239
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,430
其他人在哪  被你藏起来的在哪

我不会出卖朋友的

241
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,160
朋友
"Friends."

242
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,130
这是一场侵略
This is an invasion.

243
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,700
当有天我们醒来时  地球就变他们的了
One day we wake up... They're in charge.

244
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:32,270
你看见有谁想统治地球了
You see anybody in charge?

245
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,670
他们只是不停得从天上掉下来
They just keep falling out of the sky.

246
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,510
天上掉东西   你没办法用枪解决
Something's coming, and you can't shoot your way out of it.

247
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,600
那是什么
What was that?

248
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,410
那是个错误
That was a mistake.

249
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,490
当心  当心  当心
Watch out, watch out, watch out!

250
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,950
下次你再开枪打谁
Next time you shoot somebody,

251
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:55,620
先确定他死了再靠近他
don't go near 'em till you're sure they're dead.

252

把武器放下  相信我
Put the weapon down, trust me!

253
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,290
放松  大黄蜂  放松

打他啊
Shoot him!

256
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,430
你肯定死在我前面
You're dead before I hit the ground.

257
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,540

开枪
Take the shot!

00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,310
开枪
Shoot!

260
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,510
住手  黄蜂
Don't do it, Bee!

261
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,510
别开火  停下
Hold your fire! Hold it!

262
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,310
你  放下枪
You! Drop it!

263
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,210
想得美
I'm not dropping shit.

264
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,480
军方也不像这样  黄蜂  你要相信我们
The military doesn't want it this way, Bee, you gotta believe that.

265
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,590
现在政权变了  这些人说了算
It's a new world order now and these guys are calling the shots.

266
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,660
他们只想要一个家  你心里明白得很
All they want is a home, and you know it.

267
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:34,330
要是逼他们  他们会立马反击
You push them, and they push right back.

268
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,430
猎犬来了
Hound's in town.

269
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,430
最喜欢早晨打一战了
Love starting the day off with a gunfight.

270
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,500
抱歉我来晚了  我来这劲爆舞会的邀请信
Sorry I'm late. My invitation to this ass-kicking

271
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,500
肯定是寄丢了
must've got lost in the mail!

272
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,010
我和队员要撤了
Me and my crew are rolling out of here.

273
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,340
- 把你的飞机撤走  - 我们走
- Call off your birds. -Let's go.

274
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,510
他们不会动我们的
They're not gonna touch us.

275
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:54,350
星空一号  撤离  没发现霸天虎的踪迹
All right, Star 1, abort. Negative Decepticon activity.

276
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,350
变形金刚反应部队别动  放下枪
TRF, stand fast. Drop your guns.

277
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,490
你确定不开枪吗  我可是你们的目标呢
You sure you don't want to shoot? I'm a big ol' target.

278
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,720
胆小鬼
Wusses.

279
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,390
你到底站哪一边
Whose side are you on?

280
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,590
他们都是坏人
They're all bad.

281
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,660
才不是
No, they're not.

282
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,460
鹰眼  标记他
Eagle Eye, tag him.

283
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,270
我从未见过像它这样的  将军
I've never seen one like it, General.

284
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,370
这个更古老  比擎天柱还老
This one's older, older than Optimus Prime.

285
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:24,640
路障也在同样的地点被发现
Decepticon Barricade was spotted at that same location.

286
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:32,420
CIA在他身上用了捕食者监视他有一阵了
CIA's had him under Pred surveillance for a while now.

287
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:42,460
他一直和一些有趣的对象有来往
Yeah, he's been keeping some interesting company.

288
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,860
权杖被藏在地球上
The staff is hidden on Earth.

289
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,670
充满终极力量的武器
A weapon of ultimate power.

290
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,670
我们会找到它
We'll find this staff.

291
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,540
那声音
That voice.

292
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,640
就像噩梦里一样
I can hear it in my nightmares.

293
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,540
- 威震天  - 有待确认
-Megatron. - Waiting for authentication.

294
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,610
就是他
It's him.

295
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,540
威震天大人
Lord Megatron.

296
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,350
别照着我的脸
Get that out of my face.

297
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,720
汇报
Report.

298
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,620
请告诉我你找到了护身符
Tell me you have found the talisman.

299
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:08,690
我看到了  一个濒死骑士交给了人类
I saw it. A dying knight gave it to a human.

300
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,460
但那里有太多变形金刚反应部队人力了
But there was too much TRF firepower.

301
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,890
你居然让护身符被别人夺走了
You let the talisman get away!

302
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,700
我们必须得到它
We must have it!

303
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:20,830
没有护身符  我们就无法找到权杖
Without the talisman, we cannot find the staff!

304
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,370
我知道谁能带我们找到
I know who can lead us to it.

305
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,840
变形金刚反应部队
The TRF.

306
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,570
总司令命令那武器
Commander in Chief wants that weapon,

307
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:32,680
或者叫它权杖  不论一切都要保护好
or "staff" as he calls it, secured at all cost.

308
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:35,580
保留你在变形金刚反应部队的卧底身份
Maintain your covert embed with TRF.

309
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,820
长官  他们只是不懂
Sir... They just don't get it.

310
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,720
我们与大黄蜂还有变形金刚的历史
Our history with Bee and the Autobots.

311
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:45,730
我们多希望擎天柱能回来
What we would all give to have Prime back right now.

312
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,490
擎天柱

00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:51,730
再次进入赛伯坦
Re-entry Cybertron.

314

我的世界
My world!

315
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:20,430
我的世界怎么了
What has happened to my world?

316
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,860
你的世界濒临死亡
Your world is dying.

317
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,930
我在等你  擎天柱
I've been waiting for you, Optimus.

318
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,870
来见见你的创造者
Come meet your maker.

319
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,810
你是我的创造者
You are my creator?

320
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,210
我是昆塔沙  造物主
I am Quintessa, the Prime of Life.

321
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,550
你对我的家圆做了什么
What have you done to my home?

322
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:50,720
我要杀了你
I will kill you!

323
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,490
你胆敢袭击你的神
You dare to strike your god?

324
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,600
你的战争毁了赛博坦
Your war doomed Cybertron.

325
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,700
是威震天挑起的战争
Megatron started the war!

326
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:08,210
是你摧毁了你的世界  蠢货
You destroyed your world, you fool.

327
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:13,010
我完美的造物
My perfect creation.

328
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,580
你去修正这一切
You're going to fix it,

329
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:19,520
否则变形金刚会永远绝迹
or the race of Transformers dies forever.

330
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,920
我创造了你
I made you.

331
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,930
所以要听我的命令
You are mine to command.

332
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,740
怎么跑到这来的
How did you get in here?

333
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,020
主人  我们等了1600年
My lord, that weird thing

334
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:55,860
才发生的奇怪现象出现了
we've been waiting for 1,600 years to happen...

335
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:58,860
我想这次是真的了
I think it's really happening this time!

336
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,540
骑士们到了
The knight has arrived.

337
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,540

终于  考格曼  开始了

谢谢
Okay. Thanks.

342
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,650
温布利  我有空
Wembly! I was quite open.

343
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:03,660
你经常空闲是有原因的
There's a reason why you're always open.

344
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:04,960
你一直单身也是有理由的
There's a reason you're always single.

345
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:06,960
- 什么  - 什么
- What? - What?

346
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,630
蠢货
Idiot.

347
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:28,150
天啊  好吧
God. Okay.

348
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,750
迟到了  迟到了
So late, so late, so late.

349
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:37,960
公元 484   在人类文明与野蛮之间最后一搏
484 CE. A desperate last stand between civilization and barbarism.

350
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,730
两个世界发生碰撞
Two worlds colliding.

351
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,690
只有一个世界能够幸存
Only one survives.

352
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,700
兰斯洛特  珀西瓦尔
Lancelot. Percival.

353
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:45,900
亚瑟王
King Arthur.

354
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:47,400
都是值得尊敬的人
Honorable men.

355
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:50,640
英勇无畏  体格强健
Brave, muscles sinewed,

356
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:52,770
甲光向日金鳞开
sweat glistening off their bodies.

357
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:57,070
他们是仅有几位愿意为胜利献出一切的人
A few brave men who were willing to sacrifice all for victory.

358
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,180
听着太不真实了吧  波比
Sound too good to be true, Poppy?

359
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:00,950
因为都是扯淡
Because it's horseshit.

360
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:03,520
亚瑟王
Arthur.

361
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:07,690
可能是罗马将军与凯尔特人国王的结合体
A likely composite of a Roman general and a Celtic king.

362
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,720
我们的龙
Our dragon.

363
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,060
只是只中世纪的投石机
Just a medieval catapult.

364
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:14,190
然后梅林
And then we have Merlin,

365
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,030
拥立国王者
our Kingmaker.

366
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:18,230
可能从未存在过
Probably never existed.

367
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,900
问题是
The question is,

368
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:24,200
为什么  为什么我们要给自己编这些故事
why? Why do we tell ourselves these stories?

369
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,940
除了广而告之龙是邪恶之外
Other than the fact that dragons are wicked.

370
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,910
因为那是我们希望相信
It's because we want to believe.

371
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:34,010
希望这些英雄存在于我们的生活中
Believe that we can be heroes in our own lives.

372
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:36,720
当世界崩塌
When all seems lost,

373
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:39,050
仅剩下我们几位勇敢的人
a few brave souls, us,

374
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,190
能够拯救我们所知的一切
can save everything we've ever known.

375
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,190
还是说只有龙
Or is it just the dragons?

376
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,140
好吧
Well,

377
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,680
不用很久了  老朋友
it won't be much longer now, old friend.

378
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:06,210
世界末日的迹象就在我们身边
Signs of the end are all around us.

379
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:09,680
你知道怎么做  是不是
You know what to do, don't you?

380
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:14,290
我们必须重建家园
We must rebuild my home.

381
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:18,760
有办法拯救你的世界
There is a way to heal your world.

382
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,290
我的创造力的源泉  权杖
My power of creation, the staff,

383
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:26,970
被我的12位守护骑士偷走
was stolen from me by my 12 guardian knights.

384
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,970
他们背叛了我将它藏在了地球上
They betrayed me and hid it on Earth.

385
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,070
把它给了你珍视的人类
Gave it to your precious humans.

386
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:39,310
权杖是唯一能让赛博坦重获生机
The staff is the only way to bring life back to Cybertron.

387
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,850
你帮我去找到它
You are going to find it for me.

388
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,080
你想要得到救赎吗  擎天柱
Do you seek redemption, Prime?

389
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,850
想吗
Do you?

390
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,290
我的造物主
My maker,

391
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,860
我想
I do.

392
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:59,260
不要害怕  不要憎恨  也不要愤怒
No fear. No hate. No anger.

393
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:05,170
不要害怕  不要憎恨  也不要愤怒
No fear. No hate. No anger.

394
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,970
别碰我  你这个蛆虫
Get off, you maggot!

395
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:12,280
我要杀了你  飞鼠
I will kill you, flying rat!

396
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,550
他还很小  很烦人
He's very little. Very tiring.

397
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,990
坐在这丧失理智
Losing our heads sitting around here.

398
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,020
受够了隐藏
So tired of hiding.

399
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:35,100
酋长  真是
Hey, Chief! Nice...

400
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,570

真是匹好马
Nice horse you got there.

402
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,170
你还真是对这些印第安东西着了迷
You're really getting into this whole Indian thing?

403
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:44,010
别叫我酋长  我叫雪曼
Don't call me Chief. My name is Sherman.

404
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,810
你不是酋长吗
Aren't you the tribal chief?

405
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:48,010
嗯  但听起来似乎
Yeah. But from you it sounds...

406
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:49,950
不知道  有点种族歧视啊
I don't know, vaguely racist.

407
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:53,190
- 我的巡逻车被偷了  - 什么
- My cruiser got stolen. -What?

408
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,590
- 第二次了  - 太惨了
- Again. - That's terrible!

409
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,890
你猜怎么的
You know what?

410
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,020
事态控制不住了
Shit's getting out of control.

411
00:28:59,050 --> 00:28:59,560
到处都是犯罪
There's crime going on everywhere!

412
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,030
我很多东西都被偷了
A bunch of my stuff got stolen.

413
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,890
别扯淡  凯德  把我车还我
Cut the shit, Cade... And get me my car back.

414
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,710
大成功
Booyah! Big time.

415
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,710
一直就想说了
Been holding that one in for a while.

416
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,950
该死  忘了还有个集束炸弹了
Damn, forgot about that cluster bomb.

417
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,880
喂
Yo!

418
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,920
有什么毛病  老兄
What's your problem, dude?

419
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,560
下回  刹车轻一点
Next time, ease on the brakes!

420
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:41,860
这是我的风格  我喜欢隆重出场
That's the way I roll. I like to make a statement when I arrive.

421
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,890
营地都被你弄上灰了
Well, you're getting dust all over the campus!

422
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:45,630
这里才不是营地  是垃圾场
This ain't no campus. It's a junkyard!

423
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,760
快点  快点   快来  快来
Come on, hustle. ?ándale! ?ándale!

424
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,300
吉米
Jimmy!

425
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:53,800
别冲我发火
Hey, don't take any aggression out on me.

426
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:56,540
该死  钢锁  我们是客人
Damn it, Grimlock! We're guests here!

427
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,910
你陷入麻烦了吗
You got in some shit?

428
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,080
都快找上门了
Yeah, neck deep!

429
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:04,050
凯德  这就是你带大黄蜂出去的下场
Cade, that's what you get for taking the yellow bugger.

430
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,920
你需要找个领导  比如我
You need a leader out there... Like me.

431
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,850
闭嘴  免得我给你带来
Shut up. Before I do some damage

432
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,690
无法恢复的伤害
you won't walk away from.

433
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,650
你永远成不了擎天柱
You will never be Optimus Prime.

434
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:13,790
话太多
You talk too much.

435
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,660
拜托  老兄  百万多岁的传奇战士
Come on, man. Million-year-old legendary warrior

436
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,760
你们却表现的像一堆垃圾狗一样
and you act like a bunch of junkyard dogs!

437
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,090
你惹毛我了
You're starting to piss me off!

438
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,740
吉娃娃
Ay, chihuahua!

439
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,640
快回来  钢锁
Come back here, Grimlock!

440
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:29,670
转过来  你嘴里有什么
Turn around. What do you got in your mouth?

441
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,880
我发誓  保护你是浪费时间
I swear, I am wasting my time protecting you.

442
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:36,580
放下巡逻车
Drop the cruiser right now!

443
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,920
我知道你吃了雪曼司令的巡逻车
I know you got Chief Sherman's cruiser.

444
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,050
放下
Drop it!

445
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,820
这样才对  吐出来  快
Serves you right. Spit it out! Spit it!

446
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,930
别吃车  别吃车
Don't eat cars. Don't eat cars.

447
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,770
回到你的洞去  反省反省
You get back in your hole and think about what you did.

448
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,970
就好像是梅西百货感恩节的游行一样热闹啊  吉米
It's like the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade out here, Jimmy J.

449
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:08,810
你从达科塔分账报的一则招人启示中雇佣了我
You hired me from a want ad in the Dakota Penny Ledger.

450
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,110
你以为我有超能力吗
Think that comes with a superpower?

451
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,880
那是恐龙  外星恐龙
That is a dinosaur! An alien dinosaur!

452
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:17,390
广告里可没说
That was not in the ad!

453
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,020
昨天还想吃了我来着
It tried to eat me yesterday.

454
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,820
你想进联邦监狱吗
You want to go to federal prison?

455
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:23,390
不  我不想进任何监狱
No, no, I don't want to go to any prison.

456
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:24,430
你肯定要进监狱的
Well, that's where you're gonna go, okay?

457
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,860
因为你是从犯
'Cause you're aiding and abetting.

458
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,760
我是逃犯
I'm a fugitive, all right?

459
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,130
我是大老板  你只是我的小喽啰
I'm the big boss, you're my little crimey.

460
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,830
你走后
When you leave,

461
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,800
这就变得跟动物世界一样
it becomes the Wild Kingdom out here.

462
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,040
我不知道该怎么做
I don't know what to do.

463
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,400
我说过这里是垃圾场
I told you, this is a junkyard.

464
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,800
他们和垃圾融为一体了  仅此而已
They blend in with other junk. That's it.

465
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,910
你将我雇佣为国际公司的高级副主席
You hired me to be senior vice president of worldwide operations.

466
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,940
- 我说过吗  - 你是这么说的
- Did I tell you that? - Yes, that's what you said.

467
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,910
我瞎编的
I made that shit up.

468
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,880
请别把我的头衔拿走  凯德
Do not take this title away from me, Cade.

469
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:46,010
这里不是创业公司  我干这个不是为了赚钱
This is not a startup, okay? I don't do this shit for money.

470
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:47,020
是为了更远大的事业
It's for the higher cause.

471
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:47,880
你不是为了赚钱吗
You don't do this shit for the money?

472
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,890
你有什么毛病  你打算怎么吃
What's wrong with you? How you gonna eat?

473
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:51,650
他来这做什么
What's he doing here?

474
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:59,130
地球上最烦人的变形金刚来了
Here comes the most irritating, annoying Transformer on Earth.

475
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,160
我应该袭击他吗
Should I frag him?

476
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,030
他为了过那个门给了你什么
What did he give you to get past the gate?

477
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,130
什么都没给
Nothing!

478
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:05,140
凯德  他把这个给了他
Hey, Cade. He gave him this.

479
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,770
我从来没见过这个
I've never seen that before in my life.

480
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,240
说出来  你想要那外星炸弹
Come on, say it! You wanted the alien blaster.

481
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:12,180
你说过真男人要有好枪
You said a big gun makes a big man.

482
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,240
你知道人类脾气不好  对吧
Hey, you know human beings lose their temper, right?

483
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,180
- 你敢  - 过来
- Don't you dare! Hey, hey! - Come here!

484
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,480
最糟糕的高级副主席
The worst senior vice president...

485
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,550
停下  停下
Stop it! Stop it!

486
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,820
你真男人  你健身了吗
Yeah, you're real tough! What, you been working out?

487
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:23,090
- 我要去炸他  - 绝对的
- I'm going to frag him. - Definitely frag him.

488
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,460
我听到了  探长
I heard that, Hound.

489
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:25,690
别冲动
Easy!

490
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,930
天  你总是靠暴力解决问题
God. You always resort to violence right off the bat.

491
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,790
我喜欢暴力
I love violence.

492
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:32,460
交易员  你怎么会在这
Daytrader! The hell are you doing here?

493
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,900
找到你的太空船了吗
You find our spaceship yet?

494
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,160
我不想在这附近晃悠了
I'm getting tired of hanging around here,

495
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,500
简直是等死
waiting to catch a bullet.

496
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:39,140
一氧化碳  以及或许偶尔的酗汽油
Carbon monoxide, and perhaps a small gasoline drinking problem

497
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:42,040
在子弹打死你之前就能让你死  我的胖友
are gonna kill you long before a bullet, my corpulent comrade.

498
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,870
- 滚  别让我看到你  - 小心  伙计们  停下
- Back off! Get out of my face. - Watch it! Guys, stop!

499
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:44,940
你想和探长打一架吗
You want to throw down with Hound?

500
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,180
硬汉  没礼貌
Tough guy? Rude.

501
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,980
你来拿这些东西怎么样
How about you trying to carry all this stuff?

502
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,880
看我在布法罗找到了什么
Look what I found in Buffalo.

503
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:02,350
红蜘蛛的头  女士们先生们
Starscream's head, ladies and gentlemen.

504
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,320
看我找到了什么  大黄蜂有新音箱了
Look what I got. New voice box for Bee.

505
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,420
这回会成功吗
Is it gonna work this time?

506
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,390
我只有好东西  凯德  好不好
I only got the good stuff, Cade. Come on.

507
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,690
听到了吗  黄蜂  你能说话了  兄弟
You hear that, Bee? You're gonna talk, buddy!

508
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,360
蹲下  黄蜂
Get down, Bee!

509
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,430
你还有什么
All right, what else you got?

510
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,230
你从哪拿的那垃圾
Where'd you get that piece of junk?

511
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:22,270
这垃圾堆里会有守护骑士的护身符
A Knight of lacon talisman in this dump?

512
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,540
绝对不是真的
Nah, it's not real.

513
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:24,940
是吗  不  绝不是真的
Is it? No, definitely not.

514
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,140
嘿  给我  我帮你处理掉
Hey, give it to me, I'll take it off you.

515
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,510
你以为我不知道这玩意是什么吗  有多重要
You think I don't know what the hell this is? How valuable?

516
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,240
但我知道这肯定很重要  因为
But I know it's something, because it's got you

517
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,410
你对这玩意垂涎欲滴  你个邋遢鬼
licking your chops, you skank.

518
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,380
说话真伤人  凯德
Words hurt, Cade.

519
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:34,580
一共有七个  数一数
There are exactly seven... Count them.

520
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,520
七个天气来临的征兆
Seven signs of the apocalypse.

521
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:39,390
那里的那个护身符出现就是第一个
And that talisman showing up here is numero uno.

522
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,920
如果那个可爱的铁饼是真的
If that fancy pancake was real,

523
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,930
我会抓起宇宙飞船  然后让这个脏兮兮的星球灰飞烟灭
I'd grab the spaceship and blow this dirtball planet.

524
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,460
好吧  我得给自己涂点油了
All right, I'm gonna go slather myself in oil.

525
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,700
如果你感觉不适的话  漂移  转过去
Turn your back, Drift, if it offends your sensibilities.

526
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,970
那种东西可是很难视而不见的
Now that is something you can't unsee.

527
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,670
我不太理解你在说什么
I barely understand what's coming out of your mouth.

528
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,700
嘿  嘿  先生
Hey! Hey, mister!

529
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,390
这可不行
This isn't happening.

530
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:58,260
你不能呆在这里  孩子  我这已经不少流浪汉了
You cannot stay here, kid. I got enough strays.

531
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:01,190
我不是小孩  我很有用的  我会修东西
I'm not a kid! I'm useful. I fix shit.

532
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,260
- 那太棒了  - 比别人都厉害
- Yeah, good for you. - Better than anyone.

533
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:04,460
而且我有名字
And I have a name, you know.

534
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:06,260
是伊莎贝拉  有字母z的那个
It's Izabella. Izabella with a Z.

535
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,470
我才不关心带不带z或者颜文字  还是美元符号神马的
I don't care if it's a Z, an emoji, or a dollar sign,

536
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,670
好吗  我这里可没地方给
all right? This is no place for...

537
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,600
回家吧  拜托了
Just go home. Please.

538
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,300
我没有家
I don't got a home.

539
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:16,170
而且他们
And they...

540
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:18,410
而且他们刚刚杀了
They just killed

541
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,310
我最后一位可称为家人的生灵
the last thing that I called family.

542
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,180
所以  不
So no,

543
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,550
我哪也不去
I'm not going anywhere.

544
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,590
我想留下  并且和他们对抗
I want to stay and I want to fight them.

545
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,230
你没法与他们对抗  你也不可能打败他们
You can't fight them, and you can't beat them.

546
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:38,340
好吗  整个世界都支持他们
All right? They have the support of the entire world.

547
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,700
而你  你只是个孩子
You, you're a kid.

548
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,240
你怎么还跟着我
Why are you still following me?

549
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,620
T
T!

550
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,320
第一次喷火  哥们
First flames, dude!

551
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:57,360
嘿  先生  你的拖车着火了
Hey! Mister! Your trailer's on fire.

552
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,460
嘿  到转角那
Hey, corner.

553
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,030
我的天啊  哥们  我为你自豪
My God. Buddy! I'm proud of you.

554
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,760
但是你得去外面喷火  好吗
I know, but you gotta do it outside now, okay?

555
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:05,760
不然你会把这里都烧没了的
You could burn this whole place down.

556
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,770
我知道  但是你现在能量过剩  好吗
I know, but you're coming into your power now, all right?

557
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,600
所以你要喷火  不
So you gotta blow the flames... No.

558
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,440
特里  帮我拿个啤酒好吗
Terry, get me a beer, will ya?

559
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,370
嘿  伙计们  你们得停下
Hey, guys, you gotta cut the crap.

560
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:18,740
你们把所有东西都弄坏了
You're tearing everything apart.

561
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:25,420
送的好  哥们  只是拿的水平还得提高
Perfect delivery, buddy. You gotta work on the pickup.

562
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,720
我还得训练他
I still got him in training.

563
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,690
你家人怎么了
What happened to your family?

564
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:36,260
你先说
You first.

565
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,730
妻子过世了  女儿在上大学
Wife passed away. Daughter's at college.

566
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,660
她也有可能登月了
She might as well be on the moon.

567
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,600
至少她还在  兄弟
At least she's still here, bro.

568
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,800
要是我去看她  我们都得被抓起来
I go and visit her, we both get arrested.

569
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,640
听起来糟糕吗  兄弟
Is that bad enough for you, "bro"?

570
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:47,810
该你了  除非你难以启齿
Your turn, unless you're too tough to share.

571
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,410
霸天虎发射了一枚火箭
Decepticon fired a rocket.

572
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,310
父母当时在家  我没有
Parents were home, I wasn't.

573
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,610
没办法  我只能被送去寄养
No way I was going to foster.

574
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:01,420
嘿  小家伙
Hey, little guy.

575
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:03,490
你可真沉
You're heavy!

576
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:06,060
你得走了  你不能呆在这
You gotta go. You can't stay here.

577
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:07,390
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

578
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,430
好吧
Fine.

579
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,570
好吧
Fine.

580
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,230
我早上会回来的
I'll bounce in the morning.

581
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:21,400
好吧  听着  你要是饿了  我这里有冷冻披萨卷饼
Great. Look, if you're hungry, I got some frozen pizza burritos.

582
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,410
冰箱里可能还有些零食
There might be some Smucker's in the fridge.

583
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,380
我会告诉所有人你在哪里
And tell everyone where you are.

584
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,350
嘿  我是被一个12岁的小孩威胁了吗
Hey, am I being blackmailed by a 12-year-old?

585
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,350
14岁
Fourteen.

586
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,120
你还真是错过了大好的年华
You know, you're really missing out.

587
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,850
做一个小孩没什么不好  厉害小孩
'Cause it's okay to be a kid, Little J-Lo.

588
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:35,520
你认为自己是个狠角色吗
You think you're a bad-ass?

589
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,420
好吧  女汉子  突击测试
All right, tough guy, I got a pop quiz for you.

590
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:39,760
假设在Slant-6引擎上有个内联的能量晶体泄漏
Say you got an inline Energon leak on a Slant-6.

591
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:42,090
不把它修好  汽车人能量就会流尽
Don't get it fixed, Autobot's about to bleed out.

592
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:44,100
你有30秒时间  现在回答  你会怎么做
You got 30 seconds. Now, what are you gonna do? Go.

593
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:46,760
好的  首先  变形金刚没有Slant-6引擎
All right. First of all, Transformers don't have a Slant-6.

594
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,830
那是克莱斯勒的发动机  古老的款式
That's a Chrysler engine, like way back in ancient history.

595
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,440
60年代末不算是古老
The late '60s are not ancient history.

596
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:53,000
对  但如果我要解决的是能量晶体泄漏
Yeah, but if I was fixing an Energon leak,

597
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,870
我会烧结干路并把中央流改路至那个  那个
I'd cauterize the artery and re-channel the central flow into the... The...

598
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:57,740
就是那个玩意  那个管子带有
The whatchamacallit, the tube with the...

599
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:59,880
- 一个小东西  - 对

不  比那更糟

668

669
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:01,950
你要保持警惕  因为他不是我们的朋友

这就是我们生活的世界
Well, that's the world we live in.

769

天天刷牙  努力学习

远离所有乐队里的男孩  尤其是鼓手

我会说  明天再说
And I'd say, "I'll figure it out tomorrow."

778
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:27,910
看上去你的明天不多了啊  耶格
Looks to me like you're running out of tomorrows, Yeager.

779
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:31,280
她就会这样说
That's just what she'd say.

780

This is such bullshit.

你离开了我  他们就要把吱吱带走了

这是什么  这个跟踪器直接把他们带向了我们

832
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:28,330
- 你什么时候才能长大啊  - 妹的

至少让我拿着我的冲击枪吧

- 放下他  - 妈的

你以为我怕你吗  傻逼

我们不搞这种自杀式行动

这个计划完蛋了
That plan went to shit.

883

你就这一个计划吗
That's the only plan you got?

00:52:58,570 --> 00:52:59,840
蹲下  蹲下  蹲下
Get down, get down, get down!

885

TRF.

887
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:08,480
我们得进屋  来  跑起来
We gotta get inside. Come on. Run.

888
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:10,550
这些人应该去抓捕恐怖分子
This is supposed to hunt terrorists,

889
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:11,850
不是美国纳税人
not tax-paying Americans!

890
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,450
也不是说我纳税  但是
Not that I pay taxes, but...

891
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:16,520
老威  威老天
Yo, Meg! M-tron!

00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:25,730
这可不对
This ain't right.

894
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:33,870
我们在这里很安全
We're safe in here.

895

总有一个领头的
There's always one in charge.

896
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:37,410
像在芝加哥那时候  像妈妈一样的人

我是说  这有不少广告  有一部分很有吸引力
I mean, there are lots of adverts, some of them very tempting.

1045
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:23,030
这个在找一个BBW  我不知道那是什么意思吗
This one's looking for a BBW. I don't know what that is.

1046
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:24,370
- 那是种车  亲  - 好吧

历史正在被改写  而你却想要谈论男人

1055
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:41,680

1060
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:51,930
不过是些旧书罢了

现在我有点盼望世界末日的到来了
Now I welcome the end of days!

1062
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:55,130
我只是希望你能找到像你父亲这样对的人
What's so terrible about me wanting you

1063
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:57,070
这有什么不好吗

1064
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:58,400
他是个混球
He was an ass.

1065
01:02:58,430 --> 01:02:59,670
你知道父亲没有什么吗

主人  这家伙就是个楞头青

对于刚才的事我感到很抱歉  你看
I'm awfully sorry about that, but, you see,

1112

他以为现在还是1918或者1914年  大概就那段时间
he thinks it's still the year 1918 or 1914. Something like that.

1118
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:53,170
到处都是血迹和成堆的尸体  着实令人伤感
and gore and all that. It's terribly sad.

1119
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,600
离蒂珀雷里还远  家乡遥遥无际
"It's a long way to Tipperary, it's a long way to go."

1120
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:58,240
那真的是太残酷了
Yeah, but it's... It's terrible!

1121
01:06:58,270 --> 01:07:00,910
太惨烈了  你知道吗  但是当时
I mean, so sad, you know? But then, I mean...

1122
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:03,610
不是吗  我是说  这种迟发性的

机器人痴呆

01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:12,150
我不知道你那烟管里抽得是什么

这里到底是怎么回事
What's going on here?

1127

你是把我拉到什么
Did you drag me to some

1128
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:16,260
变形金刚的养老院了吗
Transformer retirement home?

1129
01:07:16,290 --> 01:07:18,190
听着  最好有人能给我解释一下  不然我可要走了
Look, somebody better start talking, or I'm outta here.

1130
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:19,530

我们只在我小时候见过一面
We only met when I was a little boy in short pants.

1133
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:24,470
我大概那么高
I must have been that tall.

1134
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:27,270
也许高点  也许矮点  我记不得了
Maybe taller. Or maybe shorter, I can't remember.

1135
01:07:27,470 --> 01:07:28,540
但从不会忘记别人的长相
But never forget a face.

1136
01:07:28,570 --> 01:07:29,740
大黄蜂  你认识这个家伙吗
Bee, you know this guy?

1137
01:07:31,970 --> 01:07:33,640
我们来看看这个东西
Let's have a look at this thing.

1138
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:35,310
可以吗  这很有趣
Please. Very interesting.

1139
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:37,650
没错
Yes.

1140
01:07:38,980 --> 01:07:42,220
你保守这个秘密这么长时间  知道那是真的
You keep a secret for so long, knowing it to be true,

1141
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:43,750
然而  内心深处
and yet, deep down inside,

1142
01:07:44,450 --> 01:07:46,390
你却产生疑问
you begin to wonder,

1143
01:07:46,990 --> 01:07:49,260
我的人生被荒废了吗
"Has my life been wasted?"

1144
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:52,230
你有没有过那样的感觉  凯德先生
Have you ever felt like that, Mr. Cade?

1145
01:07:54,030 --> 01:07:55,460
叫我凯德就好
It's just Cade.

1146
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:58,470
听着  老前辈  我现在可没那么多耐心陪你猜谜语
Look, old timer, I don't have a ton of patience for riddles right now.

1147
01:07:59,030 --> 01:08:01,740
没错  但是你想要知道  不是吗  老兄
Yes, but you want to know, don't you, "dude,"

1148
01:08:02,670 --> 01:08:04,340
他们为什么不断来到这里
why they keep coming here.

1149
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:07,640
来到地球  对吗
To Earth. Right?

1150
01:08:10,310 --> 01:08:13,320
我很欣赏掐准时机的人
I do so love perfect timing.

1151
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:18,590

不  不  别跑  小姐
No, no, no, little lady.

1153
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:31,030
你为什么非要这个样子呢  为什么【法】
Why do you have to be like that? Pourquoi?

1154
01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:34,670
这是因为她被绑架了
So, is this a kidnapping sort of situation

1155
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:37,010
还是因为 她第一次见变形金刚
or her first Transformer experience?

1156
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,340
其实二者都有
It's both, really.

1157
01:08:38,370 --> 01:08:40,280
别再打我了
Do not hit me again!

1158
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:44,280
但是她的战逃反应很不错
But she does have a rather nice fight-or-flight response.

1159
01:08:44,650 --> 01:08:47,280
她可真难搞
She's very difficult.

1160
01:08:48,550 --> 01:08:51,420
我叫埃德蒙·伯顿  弗尔根伯爵十二世

还好吗
What's up?

1163
01:09:04,730 --> 01:09:06,500
他非要倚在那吗
Does he have to loom like that?

1164
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:11,840
惹什么
"Ut" what?

1165
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:14,610

01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:21,580
不  他只是喜欢那个口音
No, he just likes the accent.

1170
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:25,490
不  不  不  我讨厌这口音  但是我摆脱不了它
No, no, no! I hate the accent! But I can't get rid of it.

1171
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,390
我改不掉这个口音了
I'm stuck with the accent.

1172
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:28,660
他是位军人  薇薇安小姐

他向你的父亲宣誓要保护你

1174

Some dad you got there.

1175
01:09:34,130 --> 01:09:35,730
那车真不错  要我说  你开着他
That is a nice ride. I mean, you can roll right up

1176
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:37,400
去白金汉宫都不成问题

好了 你  美国佬  闭嘴
Okay, you, American man, shut it.

1178

我来这是做什么的
What am I doing here?

1179
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:44,710
- 是啊  为什么要把她请来  - 给你们介绍一下
- Yeah, why is she here? - Introductions.

老兄  我被你那奇怪的伙计一直追
Dude, I was getting chased when your little weirdo buddy

1334
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:03,780
直到把我带到这来
brought me over here on the plane.

1335
01:17:04,150 --> 01:17:05,250
纯贞
"Chaste."

1336
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:07,020
纯  贞
C-H-A-S-T-E.

1337
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:08,220
贞
"T."

1338
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:09,080
禁欲
Celibate?

1339
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:10,950
我知道  我只是逗你们
Yeah, I know... I was making a joke.

1340
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:12,220
你以为我不会吗
You don't think I know how to spell?

1341
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:14,120
- 我知道他的意思  - 当然了
-I know what he meant. -Sure you were.

1342
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:15,960
不打打飞机吗  凯德先生
No whoopee, Mr. Cade?

1343
01:17:17,030 --> 01:17:18,560
很久没有了
It's been a while.

1344
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:21,200
很久是多久  一周  一个月  一年
Well, how long's "a while"? A week? A month? A year?

1345
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:23,030
不关你事
None of your business.

1346
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:24,770
我们得问你这个问题
Well, we need to ask you the question.

1347
01:17:25,570 --> 01:17:26,570
很久就是很久
A while!

1348
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:30,910
这又是英国人的毛病吗
Is that, like, another English thing?

1349
01:17:30,940 --> 01:17:33,210
不  只是我们好奇
No, no. Just a curious thing.

1350
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:34,810
也许我守身如玉呢
Well, maybe I'm saving myself.

1351
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:36,310
你为什么要守身如玉  老头
What are you saving yourself for, old age?

1352
01:17:36,340 --> 01:17:38,050
你这个英国女人  闭嘴
You, English lady, shut it.

1353
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,380
这是什么  地图吗
What is this? Some sort of a map?

1354
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:44,850
这桌子来自赛博坦
This table is from Cybertron.

1355
01:17:44,890 --> 01:17:47,990
这是我研究了一阵子的地图
It's a puzzle I've been working on for some time.

1356
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:49,090
其实研究一生了
My entire life, actually.

1357
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:52,030
这些字符是什么意思
And what do these glyphs say about it?

1358
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:53,290
古赛博坦语
They're Olde Cybertronian.

1359
01:17:54,130 --> 01:17:57,030
从宇宙低声传来的咒语
A mantra whispered through the cosmos.

1360
01:17:57,930 --> 01:17:59,900
保护法杖
"Seglass ni Tonday."

1361
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:01,400
等下
Wait a minute.

1362
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:03,200
我听过
I heard that before.

1363
01:18:04,610 --> 01:18:07,310
船上的骑士说过  是什么意思
A knight on a ship. What does it mean?

1364
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:10,350
用你最后一口气  保护好法杖
"With your dying breath, protect the staff."

1365
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:13,380
这太荒唐了
Okay, this is ridiculous.

1366
01:18:19,220 --> 01:18:21,060
他们为它起了名字
They had their name for it.

1367
01:18:21,090 --> 01:18:22,260
我们也有
We have ours.

1368
01:18:23,090 --> 01:18:24,330
梅林之杖
The staff of Merlin.

1369
01:18:25,690 --> 01:18:29,000
外星人赠与给他的  融合了他的基因
Bequeathed to him by an alien race. Fused with his DNA.

1370
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:32,970
因此只有他才有打开它里面外星力量的钥匙
So that only he would have the key to unlock its alien power.

1371
01:18:34,030 --> 01:18:36,240
也就是如今的
Or as they knew it in those days,

1372
01:18:36,970 --> 01:18:38,170
魔法
magic.

1373
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:43,850
这只法杖葬在了梅林身边
The staff was buried with Merlin's body.

1374
01:18:44,110 --> 01:18:46,210
我们藏了一千年
A thousand years we've kept it hidden.

1375
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:49,250
若是落入坏人手中
If it ever fell into the wrong hands, it would mean

1376
01:18:49,450 --> 01:18:53,860
我们身边爱着的一切便不就会毁灭
the imminent destruction of everything we know and love.

1377
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:58,230
12位守护骑士合体变成了龙来保护它
The 12 Guardian Knights combined into a mighty dragon to protect it.

1378
01:18:58,260 --> 01:19:00,330
现在它陷入了大麻烦
And now it is in great danger.

1379
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:03,200
威震天  他在找它
Megatron. He was after this.

1380
01:19:03,230 --> 01:19:04,930
所以大战要来临了
So the battle is upon us.

1381
01:19:04,970 --> 01:19:06,670
这就是他们在这的原因  为什么他们一直来地球
It is why they're here, why they keep coming to Earth.

1382
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:09,370
我们必须在太迟之前拿走法杖
And we must claim the staff before it is too late.

1383
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:11,010
等下  干嘛
Wait. We what?

1384
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:14,040
只有一位梅林的直系后代
Only a direct descendant of Merlin himself

1385
01:19:14,410 --> 01:19:17,410
能够挥动这拥有绝对权力的法器
can wield this instrument of absolute power.

1386
01:19:18,150 --> 01:19:20,650
而你  薇薇安小姐
And you, Miss Viviane,

1387
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:23,980
是梅林在地球上最后一位恣睢
are Merlin's last descendant here on Earth, and as such,

1388
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:25,450
因此  你是我们最后的希望
you are our last hope.

1389
01:19:26,150 --> 01:19:27,460
等下  后退一点
Okay, wait. Go back.

1390
01:19:27,490 --> 01:19:30,160
你是说我和魔法师梅林有血缘关系吗
You're saying that I'm related to the wizard Merlin?

1391
01:19:36,330 --> 01:19:37,470
有点惊讶  是不是
Bit of a shock, isn't it?

1392
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:40,430
只有你知道法杖在哪
Only you know the staff's location,

1393
01:19:40,470 --> 01:19:42,370
由你父亲传给你
imparted to you by your father.

1394
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:45,310
他肯定会留下线索  对吧
He had to leave a clue, didn't he?

1395
01:19:46,010 --> 01:19:47,240
你确定吗
Are you sure?

1396
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:49,240
看她这样似乎不知道法杖在哪
She doesn't have that "I know where the staff is" look.

1397
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:52,150
听着  我父亲唯一告诉我的是
Listen, the only thing that my father imparted to me

1398
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:53,680
离开他的书房
was to get out of his study.

1399
01:19:53,710 --> 01:19:56,080
两个世界碰撞  只有一个存活
"Two worlds colliding, only one survives."

1400
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:59,320
这是你的原话  只是你下课了
Your words exactly. Only lecture time is over.

1401
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:01,990
你就是为这而生
You were born for this.

1402
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:04,990
这是他们来这之前自己星球的最后画面
This is the latest image of their world coming here.

1403
01:20:05,190 --> 01:20:07,200
而你们都挡了他们的路
And you're all that stand in its way.

1404
01:20:07,430 --> 01:20:09,260
所以你们必须快点找到法杖
So you'd better find that staff quickly.

1405
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:10,100
快

军情六处和变形金刚反应部队来了
MI6 and TRF are here!

1409
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:21,210
撤退  快
Move it! Go!

1410
01:20:21,410 --> 01:20:23,550
长老  带我去伦敦好吗
Cogman, get me to London, okay?

1411
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:28,980
- 伪装车准备好了吗  - 快点
-The decoy car is ready? -Hurry along.

1412
01:20:31,490 --> 01:20:33,490
交给我
I got 'em boys!

1413
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:39,960
快点  快走
Hurry, move! Quick, quick, quick!

1414
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:42,200
大黄蜂带我们离开
Get us out of here, Bee.

1415
01:20:43,330 --> 01:20:46,370
快离开  我的武器能停止时间
Get out of here! My weapon will stop the time!

1416
01:20:59,310 --> 01:21:03,020
爱因斯坦估计都会被逗乐了  摸摸
Einstein would've been tickled pink. Foo-Foo!

1417
01:21:05,450 --> 01:21:07,990
快点  这边  这边走
Quick, this way, this way! Hurry!

1418
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:10,290
霰弹枪  我要霰弹枪
Shotgun. I call shotgun.

1419
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:21,040
直升机入境  可以安全降落
Inbound helos, you are clear to land.

1420
01:21:22,270 --> 01:21:24,210
伦诺克上校刚到
Colonel Lennox just hit the deck.

1421
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:28,180
我是桑托斯  美国队长  有什么消息
This is Santos, Team Leader USA. What you got?

1422
01:21:31,510 --> 01:21:33,580
变形金刚反应部队飞艇上路了
TRF airship on the way.

1423
01:21:41,290 --> 01:21:42,420
在后面等我
Meet me around back, Bee.

1424
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:46,260
我不会玩
I suck at this game!

1425
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:48,300
你咬手指的时候就出卖了自己
When you bite your nails, you give everything away.

1426
01:21:48,430 --> 01:21:50,600
妈
Mum?

1427
01:21:50,630 --> 01:21:53,300
这是凯德
Everybody, this is Cade.

1428

Do you have a dungeon?

1433
01:22:01,370 --> 01:22:03,410
老天  手像个粗糙的老树皮
My goodness! Hands like rough old maple.

看着像木头一样强壮
He looks hard as wood.

1435
01:22:05,150 --> 01:22:07,420
别碰他  我去换衣服
Don't touch him. I'm gonna go and get changed.

1436
01:22:07,450 --> 01:22:10,650
我收到一通三位一体图书馆的愤怒清洁工来的电话
I got a call from a very irate janitor at Trinity Library.

1437
01:22:11,420 --> 01:22:12,420

You're late.

1438
01:22:12,450 --> 01:22:14,490
确实  如他们所说  陷入了小麻烦
We are, as they say, in a bit of a pickle.

1439
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:16,090
现在别搞我
Do not mess with me at this moment!

1440
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:18,330
天气很热  我脾气也很爆
It's hot, and I am on a short fuse.

1441
01:22:22,230 --> 01:22:23,330
快点  去图书馆
Quick! Get to the library!

1442
01:22:23,530 --> 01:22:25,170
追人的活让我压力很大
This chasing is stressing me out.

军情六处和变形金刚反应部队要找到我们了  我们得快点
MI6 and TRF are gonna find us. We got to hurry.

1444

My dad had a lot of stuff.

1445
01:22:35,210 --> 01:22:36,580
那找到法杖的地点
So, finding the staff's location...

1446
01:22:36,610 --> 01:22:38,310
是什么意思  我们在找  什么
What does that mean? We're looking for, like, what?

1447
01:22:38,350 --> 01:22:40,450
地图  或者信件  书  或者
Like, a map, or a letter, or books, or...

1448
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:43,320
卧槽  在这里找得找一年
Holy shit! It'll take a year to find something in here.

1449
01:22:43,350 --> 01:22:45,550
不知道上哪找那该死的万一
I don't know where to find this bloody staff.

1450
01:22:45,590 --> 01:22:47,190
看看这个小假马
Look at this little fake horse.

1451
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:48,460
没准塞在它屁股里之类的
Probably stuffed in its butt or something.

1452
01:22:48,490 --> 01:22:49,490
男人就爱干蠢事
Guys do stupid stuff like that.

1453
01:22:51,490 --> 01:22:53,200
上面发生了什么
What is going on up there?

1454
01:22:54,430 --> 01:22:55,660
你查照片后面了吗
You checking behind pictures?

1455

撕了吧  使劲撕
Just rip it. Rip it apart!

1458
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:03,670
- w我拿不出来  - 太好了

我的天  攒了这么多东西
My God. Such a hoarder.

1460
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:11,350
就好像里面进了人猿泰山一样闹
It's like having Tarzan in the house.

1461
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:12,550
慢点
Slow down.

1462
01:23:14,210 --> 01:23:15,580
- 我看一眼  - 别去
-I'm gonna take a peek. -No!

1463
01:23:16,420 --> 01:23:18,490
拜托  拜托  接电话
Come on, come on. Answer me, come on!

1464
01:23:20,950 --> 01:23:22,520
该死  告诉我在哪
Damn you, tell me where it is!

1465
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:25,660
想得美  先让我加入

1466
01:23:26,660 --> 01:23:28,900
当维特维坎人  必须与众不同
To be a Witwiccan, you have to be a special person.

1467
01:23:28,930 --> 01:23:30,070

You, sir, are not.

1468
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:33,170
让我进去我就告诉你  现在马上
Read me into the club and I'll tell you. Right here, now.

1469
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:36,270
电话里吗  这太野蛮了
Over the phone? That is absolutely barbaric.

1470
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:38,170
就在电话里  快点  英国佬
Over the phone. Do it, Englishman!

作为第12位弗尔根伯爵  以神圣的亚瑟王
As the 12th Earl of Folgan, by the power imbued

1472
01:23:41,610 --> 01:23:42,680

1473

以及他的圆桌骑士联盟为名

1474
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:47,250
我授予你  西莫·卢瑟福·西蒙斯

1475
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:49,650
- 进入  - 接受  不是进入
-Entrance into... -"Admittance," not "entrance"!

1476
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:51,290
别唬我  说正确的词
Don't try to snooker me. Get it right.

1477
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:53,920
够了  够了  快点告诉我

你总是说五分钟  也就是不的意思

在黑暗年代他们就知道末日会如何开始了

赛博坦与地球共同存在

1496
01:24:30,460 --> 01:24:32,230
只是他们从不叫地球地球

他们有别的名字
They called it something else.

1498

总有一个会被另一个喜感
One will suck the other dry,

1499
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:38,600
像巨大的魅魔一样  直到只剩一方

01:24:57,020 --> 01:24:58,820
角是找到法杖地点的关键
The horns are the key to the location.

1508
01:24:59,350 --> 01:25:00,650
为什么他们胡乱地散落在

1509

地球  答案是  并没有

失控与大自然让他们分裂开来
Time and Mother Nature pulled them apart.

1511

那是盘古大陆  超大陆
That's Pangaea. The supercontinent.

1512
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:08,330
和圆桌的形状一样
It's the same shape on the Round Table.

1513

交给我  西蒙斯兄弟  别担心

我从来没有兄弟
I never had a brother.

1523

01:25:36,390 --> 01:25:37,790
薇薇安跟着梅林
"Viviane followed Merlin."

1526
01:25:39,090 --> 01:25:40,600
那是什么意思
What does that mean?

1527
01:25:40,630 --> 01:25:42,030
我的秘密储藏间
My secret cupboard!

1528

薇薇安跟着美金
"Viviane followed Merlin."

1530
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:53,410
只有梅林才能挥动魔法杖

梅林和小女孩  当然了

海军博物馆  法杖肯定在哪
Navy Museum, that's got to be where the staff is.

1533

主人  变形金刚应对小组正在紧追不舍
My lord, TRF is on our tail.

1538
01:26:19,870 --> 01:26:21,870
你怎么非把诱饵车停得那么远
Why'd you park the decoy car so far away?

1539

你真是个蠢货

好啦  别让咱俩被抓了  克格曼
Good. Don't let us get caught, Cogman.

1541
01:26:27,810 --> 01:26:29,540
我就擅长这个  大人
My speciality, my lord.

1542
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:49,530
靠  你也不是非得杀人啊
Damn! You don't have to kill people.

1543
01:26:56,140 --> 01:26:57,470
闪开
Get out of the way!

1544
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:02,580
这倒提醒我了  艾格尼丝打了个电话过来

她想知道你今晚有没有空跟她亲亲
Wondered if you're available for a bit of a snuggle this evening.

而我的路怒症又要犯了

释放怒火吧  就这样
Actualize the rage. That's it!

1559
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:15,520
想尝尝嘛
You want some?

01:28:17,750 --> 01:28:19,450
克格曼  炸了他们
Cogman, blast them!

1561
01:28:31,830 --> 01:28:32,830
好样的
Good boy.

1562
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:37,470
这是个死胡同
It's a one-way street!

1563
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:38,710
车又不是我开的  是他开的

真疼
That hurt.

1568
01:29:10,770 --> 01:29:13,580
什么鬼  你疯了吗
What the hell? You are out of your mind!

1569
01:29:18,010 --> 01:29:19,610
- 我们甩掉他们了吗  - 嘿  停下

没事  有我呢  他们只不过特喜欢潜艇
It's all right, I've got them! They just love submarines.

1572
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:26,950
他们可有点粗鲁
They're a bit rude.

1573
01:29:26,990 --> 01:29:29,020
没错  是啊  这就是新一代的年轻人
Yes, they are, aren't they? That's the modern generation.

1574
01:29:29,590 --> 01:29:32,630
而且这个博物馆要永久关门了
And this museum is closed for eternity.

1575
01:29:32,790 --> 01:29:34,800
小屁孩们  从潜艇上下来
All you boys and girls, off the sub now!

1576
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:37,770
赶紧从潜艇上下来  闪开

Go on, push! Move your fat ass! Push! Squeeze!

1578
01:29:40,030 --> 01:29:41,040
走走走
Go, go, go!

1579
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:43,740
这东西发动不起来
This thing isn't gonna run.

1580
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:48,010
任务是在未经探索的深水之中
The mission's in deep, unexplored waters.

1581
01:29:48,580 --> 01:29:49,780
真是棒极了
It's wonderful!

1582
01:29:50,010 --> 01:29:52,880
还有弥漫着酸酸的男士麝香香水的味道
And the sour-sweet musk of men in close quarters.

1583
01:29:52,910 --> 01:29:54,850
其实有点恶心  真心的
It's quite disgusting, really.

1584
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:56,520
但是这个
But now this,

1585
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:58,620
史上最伟大的计划
the greatest mission of them all,

1586
01:29:58,650 --> 01:30:00,990
这是我一辈子所渴求的任务

1587
01:30:01,690 --> 01:30:05,830
来帮助改变人类历史的潮流  知道么

1588
01:30:07,930 --> 01:30:10,530
现在呢
Now, alas,

01:30:11,770 --> 01:30:13,540
我在也不能加入你们了

但是大人  您已经等这一刻等了71年了
But, my lord, you have been waiting for this moment for 71 years.

1591
01:30:17,870 --> 01:30:20,870
我知道  但我恐怕不是当骑士的料
I know, I know, but I'm not knighthood material, I'm afraid.

1592
01:30:21,670 --> 01:30:22,780
而且
And...

1593
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:24,780
你们有你们的任务  我也有我的任务
You have your mission, and I have mine.

1594
01:30:24,810 --> 01:30:27,350
不不  你不可以把我们和那个
No, no. You are not leaving us in this tin can

1595
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:29,720
四脚神经病一起丢在这个铁罐子里  这可不行
with that four-foot mental psychopath. I don't think so.

1596
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:31,820
我更喜欢反社会分子这个称呼
I prefer the word "sociopath."

1597
01:30:31,950 --> 01:30:33,890
凯德先生  你一生所做的所有事
Mr. Cade, everything you've done in your life,

1598
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:35,990

丧妻之痛  又与女儿相隔

1600
01:30:38,690 --> 01:30:39,790

01:30:39,830 --> 01:30:43,830
这一路来风雨不断  只为了此刻
it's all just been a journey to this very moment.

1602
01:30:46,700 --> 01:30:48,040
你话真多
You talk a lot.

1603
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:51,040
我觉得我也是
Yeah, I suppose I do.

1604
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:53,670
亲爱的

1605
01:30:54,810 --> 01:30:57,040
你爸爸把联盟交给你
your father left the Alliance to you,

1606
01:30:57,850 --> 01:30:59,080
并且只交给了你
for you alone.

1607
01:30:59,110 --> 01:31:00,980
她知道该怎么做
She knows the way to the staff.

1608
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:02,980
祝你们好运
Good luck to both of you.

1609
01:31:04,420 --> 01:31:06,720
这又不是我今天干过的最奇怪的事

希望她还会开

01:31:19,430 --> 01:31:20,770
好运
Good luck!

1612
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:27,080
那不是我干的
Okay. I didn't do that.

1613
01:31:28,170 --> 01:31:29,410
下潜了  你说下潜了是什么意思
Jumped? What do you mean, jumped?

1614
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:31,680
二战老式潜艇刚刚自己下潜了
The old World War II sub jumped its moorings.

1615
01:31:31,710 --> 01:31:33,150
他们一个变形金刚里面
They're in a Transformer.

1616
01:31:43,020 --> 01:31:44,960
- 我能看看嘛  - 不行  我在看呢

1617
01:31:44,990 --> 01:31:46,430
你能让开么
Will you move?

1618
01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:48,400
伙计  别挡路  那是海水吗
God, get out of the way, man! Is that water?

1619
01:31:48,430 --> 01:31:50,860
- 大侦探真厉害  - 很明显是海水
- No shit, Sherlock. - Obviously, it's water.

1620
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:51,970

我的齿轮会卡在主轴上的

1771
01:41:07,020 --> 01:41:08,590
我们遇到了盲点
We were blinded.

1772
01:41:08,990 --> 01:41:10,520
被太阳蒙蔽了
Blinded by the sun.

1773
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:13,560
行星在群星的掩护下隐藏了自己的路线
The planet hid its approach behind our star.

1774
01:41:13,990 --> 01:41:17,430
看上去好像是故意的
It seems to be acting deliberately.

有人说这将会是全球性灾难
Some are saying that it's going to be a global killer.

1784
01:42:05,380 --> 01:42:06,680

Human civilization as we know it

1785
01:42:06,710 --> 01:42:08,480
会在十二小时后改变

据专家说  破坏将是巨大的
The destruction, we're told by experts, will be immense.

1787

老头想让我们干什么
What does the old man want us to do?

1790

大黄蜂  绕开  找个别的路  快
Bee, go around, find another way! Come on!

1791
01:42:41,750 --> 01:42:43,050

你觉得我想困在这种地方吗
Think I like winding up in a place like this?

它想让我们往这边走
It wants us to go this way.

1794
01:42:57,200 --> 01:42:59,100
交易员  那帮孙子确实带着我们的飞船回来了

来一场去前线的旅行吧
Take a field trip to the front lines.

1800
01:43:12,450 --> 01:43:13,650

Let's go make some noise.

1801

01:43:15,650 --> 01:43:17,320
我浑身充满干劲
I'm driving.

1803
01:43:17,880 --> 01:43:20,650
嘿  凯德  我虽然不太想承认这事  但是
Hey, Cade, I'm reluctant to say this to you, but

1804

我觉得你真是  太勇敢了
I think that you're quite, you know, brave.

1805

你是在夸我吗
Is that a compliment?

1806
01:43:26,460 --> 01:43:28,430
你也可以夸回我
You could throw one back my way.

1807
01:43:28,460 --> 01:43:30,330
好吧  待我组织一下语言
Well, that's got to happen organically.

1808
01:43:31,130 --> 01:43:32,700
我可是第一个进入潜艇的
I was the first off the sub.

1809
01:43:39,510 --> 01:43:40,910
停  停
Hold it! Hold.

这句话意思是  没有人应该拥有它
It means, "No one shall have it."

等一下  我们费了这么大劲下来这里  看到所有这些
Wait a minute. We came all the way down here, all this,

1833
01:45:50,870 --> 01:45:52,670

You got to be kidding me.

1838
01:46:17,300 --> 01:46:19,100
我们费劲来到这就为了这个

为了看你曾曾曾祖父的破骨头
For your ugly great-great granddad's bones

1840

1841
01:46:23,870 --> 01:46:24,740
你一定是在逗我
You got to be kidding me.

1842

我们就用这破棍怎么拯救世界

我在家门前砍一截橡树就行了
I could've cut an oak tree down at my house and...

1844
01:46:29,780 --> 01:46:31,010
你能闭嘴么  行不

你那软香糯滑的小英音现在对我没用
The smooth little romantic accent's not gonna work right now.

1846
01:46:34,780 --> 01:46:36,880
- 我没说话  - 感谢上帝
-I'm speechless. -Thank God.

1847

也许有人偷了权杖
Maybe someone stole it?

1848
01:46:38,350 --> 01:46:40,650
不  一定有别的什么东西  应该在这里的某处

我绝不能空手而归

同志们  仪器出问题了

应该是还活着
They could still be alive.

1854
01:47:05,110 --> 01:47:07,110
你这个家伙什么情况
The hell happened to you?

1855

是谁为梅林的权杖而来
Who has come for the staff?

1856

你放下枪  否则我扔下去

1870
01:48:47,910 --> 01:48:49,120
- 来啊  打我啊  - 不要

一切都不对劲  大黄蜂

看着我  擎天柱

擎天柱  你不能这么做
Prime! You can't do this.

1917

擎天柱

大黄蜂  你的声音
Bumblebee. Your voice.

1923
01:54:18,380 --> 01:54:20,050
自从赛博坦星球毁灭了
I have not heard it

1924
01:54:20,410 --> 01:54:22,980
我就再没听过你的声音了
since Cybertron fell.

1925
01:54:36,530 --> 01:54:39,530
我做了什么
What have I done?

1926
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:53,450
你错失了杀死宇宙大帝的机会
You blew your chance to kill Unicron.

1927

我就知道你做不成

你结束了  擎天柱
Your time is over, Prime.

你失败了
You failed.

1930
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:06,030
你背叛了赛博坦
You turned your back on Cybertron.

1931
01:55:06,490 --> 01:55:09,160
现在你就看着地球毁灭吧

没有  擎天柱  起来
No, Prime, get up!

1937
01:55:43,430 --> 01:55:45,630
汝选择了错误的队伍
You chose the wrong side.

1938
01:55:46,160 --> 01:55:50,640
守卫骑士要杀了我
The Guardian Knights are going to kill me.

1939
01:55:51,170 --> 01:55:53,440
昆塔沙是最大的骗子
Quintessa is the great deceiver!

1940
01:56:00,650 --> 01:56:04,220
对你的审判就是死亡
The judgment is death.

1941
01:56:34,450 --> 01:56:38,350
没有牺牲就没有胜利
Seglass ni Tonday.

1942
01:56:38,950 --> 01:56:41,420
没有牺牲就没有胜利
Seglass ni Tonday.

1943
01:56:41,450 --> 01:56:45,160
没有牺牲就没有胜利
Seglass ni Tonday.

1944
01:56:58,400 --> 01:57:01,510
凯德  我辜负了你

1945
01:57:04,280 --> 01:57:06,210

可以让我称之为

只有你才能弥补过失  擎天柱
Only you can make it right, Prime.

1950
01:57:25,730 --> 01:57:27,530
没有你我不能成功
I can't do it without you.

1951
01:57:28,630 --> 01:57:30,640
我们只有一次机会
One moment, that's all we got.

1952
01:57:31,700 --> 01:57:33,510
取决于你  擎天柱
It's up to you, Prime.

1953

因为没有你

1954
01:57:35,740 --> 01:57:37,310
我们都会死

机不可失
It's now or never.

01:57:52,520 --> 01:57:56,430
要拯救地球  我们得去赛博坦星球

擎天柱给了我们最后阶段的坐标

1972

我们得搞明白是怎么个原理的

我们得关了它
We've got to shut it down!

1975

将军  我们准备要高空跳伞到
General, we're gonna prep a HALO jump

1979
01:59:15,110 --> 01:59:16,340
那个点火室
on that ignition chamber.

1980
01:59:17,310 --> 01:59:18,480
在那些藤蔓中飞机定位不准
Planes will never nav through those vines.

1981
01:59:19,450 --> 01:59:21,410
伦诺克  相信我  我们的船就在那
Lennox, trust me. That's our ride right there.

1982
01:59:21,880 --> 01:59:24,480
我们汽车人的飞船  把鱼鹰直升机落在那

飞船会在那接我们

他们在20000英尺要干什么
They want to do what at 20,000 feet?

1987
01:59:32,760 --> 01:59:35,060
先生  有个小姑娘  一位女士  事实上是一名老师
Sir, there's this girl. Woman, actually. Teacher.

他们会帮她进到点火室

1991
01:59:42,100 --> 01:59:43,300
把权杖偷出来

1992
01:59:43,340 --> 01:59:47,340
好吧  这可能是你出的最馊的主意了
Okay, that is the dumbest idea you could possibly have!

1993
01:59:47,370 --> 01:59:49,580
个人来说  我依靠物理和数学
Personally, I'm gonna rely on physics and mathematics

1994
01:59:49,610 --> 01:59:50,640
来拯救星球
to save the planet,

1995
01:59:50,680 --> 01:59:53,350
而不是什么神秘主义  童话故事  还有什么妖魔鬼怪
not mysticism, fairies, and some hobgoblins.

1996
02:00:10,730 --> 02:00:12,500
我一生就是为了这件事
I've lived for this.

1997
02:00:12,530 --> 02:00:14,770
我生来就是要毁灭星球
I've lived to kill a planet!

为了拯救地球和她的人类
To save Earth and her people,

2011

我们要偷昆塔莎的权杖

只有你  薇薇安  能拿回来

2013

我会带路到她的房间

2014
02:02:12,520 --> 02:02:16,590
当光辉岁月铭刻在星云之上
And when the account of the ages is etched into the cosmos,

2015

这是我们最荣耀的时刻

我服务过的所有的伯爵中

我探测到权杖的能量了

这些碎片会砸死我们

现在赶紧上飞船离开挤压区

2041
02:04:47,740 --> 02:04:49,810
- 我们得离开这里  - 快到鱼鹰直升机上
-We got to bail! -Move to the Ospreys!

2042

最初的部分要开始移动了

2046

抹去城市  数百万人会死
Literally scraping away cities. Millions will die.

2047
02:05:46,200 --> 02:05:48,170
它在用地球的地热能源
It's using Earth's geothermal energy

2048
02:05:48,200 --> 02:05:50,070
来重构和重建它自己  对吧
to reconstitute, to rebuild itself, all right?

2049
02:05:50,100 --> 02:05:53,240
如果我们的地核冷却了  就像现在这样
If our core cools, which is rapidly cooling right now,

2050
02:05:53,270 --> 02:05:55,680
地球的磁场就会消失
the magnetic field dissolves, exposing us

2051
02:05:55,870 --> 02:05:57,710
我们将暴露在大剂量的宇宙辐射里
to high levels of cosmic radiation.

2052
02:05:58,280 --> 02:05:59,940
也许你们会理解这个
Maybe you'll understand this.

2053
02:06:00,240 --> 02:06:02,050
地球会变成一台微波炉
The Earth becomes a microwave.

2054

我们就是爆米花  爆米花胀袋
We're the popcorn. Jiffy Pop bag goes

2055
02:06:04,820 --> 02:06:05,820
砰

面相看着不善呀
Very mean looking.

2058
02:06:23,900 --> 02:06:26,270
那些家伙不过是胆小鬼罢了
They look like wusses to me.

2059
02:06:26,970 --> 02:06:28,870
对  他们不堪一击
No, they all messed up.

2060
02:06:29,510 --> 02:06:31,980
还有两分钟  两分钟
Two minutes! Hey, two minutes!

2061
02:06:32,140 --> 02:06:33,980
- 这个能干掉霸天虎吗  - 不能
- That thing kill Decepticons? - No.

2062
02:06:35,080 --> 02:06:36,280
我们能
We do.

2063
02:06:38,550 --> 02:06:41,990
真的有一群勇士愿意牺牲一切

我还告诉我的学生那些都是胡扯的

2065

02:06:49,990 --> 02:06:51,300
你现在就问我这个吗
Are you asking me that now?

2068
02:06:51,330 --> 02:06:52,330
对  是
Yeah, I am.

2069
02:06:52,900 --> 02:06:55,130
没计划吗  很好
No plans? Good.

2070

系好了  这一趟会很颠簸的
Strap in. It's gonna be a rough ride.

2073
02:07:02,340 --> 02:07:03,940
- 系紧点儿  - 我会帮你扣好的

2074
02:07:03,980 --> 02:07:05,310
下拉到底  对吧  就这个吗

你跳出去

2076
02:07:06,510 --> 02:07:07,750
- 然后拉这个  对吗  - 这个是我该拉的  对吧
- Then pull this, right? -This is the one I pull, right?

2077
02:07:07,780 --> 02:07:10,250
拉这个  光拉就行  玩命拉就行了
Pull? Just pull it? You just pull it as hard as you can?

2078
02:07:11,150 --> 02:07:12,150
你没事儿吧
Are you all right?

2079
02:07:13,420 --> 02:07:15,550
能借你的手机用用吗  我给女儿发条短信

2090
02:08:04,070 --> 02:08:05,970
但愿着陆的时候能容易点儿
Those birds better be softening our target.

2091
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:07,870
你这让我怎么能放心呀  伦诺克
You're not giving me that warm, fuzzy feeling, Lennox.

2092
02:08:08,240 --> 02:08:10,040
鱼鹰飞行限高一万两千英尺
The Osprey's flight ceiling is 12,000 feet.

2093
02:08:10,070 --> 02:08:11,040
我们已经翻倍了
We're double that.

2094
02:08:11,080 --> 02:08:13,180
空气太稀薄  螺旋桨吃不住力
The air's too thin, the rotor's got no grab.

2095
02:08:13,210 --> 02:08:14,880
我们得硬着陆了
We're gonna be coming in hard.

2096
02:08:15,180 --> 02:08:17,220
- 全是坏消息  - 没错

You got something to say?

2099

你和你的人一直都在抓我
You and your guys never stopped hunting me.

2100

是命令  你当时和他们是一伙的
Orders. You were with them.

2101
02:08:27,660 --> 02:08:28,460
什么他们
With "them"?

2102
02:08:29,190 --> 02:08:31,030
我信仰的可是一个伟人
I believed in one of the great ones.

2103
02:08:31,060 --> 02:08:33,300
他是擎天柱  还有他的队伍  我一直都很相信他们
Optimus Prime. And his crew. I never lost faith.

2104
02:08:34,130 --> 02:08:36,170
你们不信他  全世界都不信他
You didn't. The whole world didn't.

2105
02:08:36,370 --> 02:08:38,040
现在你们又想和我一起了
Now you want to fly with me.

2106
02:08:40,200 --> 02:08:43,210
好吧  我很感谢你们安排此行  谢谢
Well, I appreciate you guys making the trip. Thank you.

2107
02:08:49,250 --> 02:08:50,380
拿下那个权杖
Get that staff,

2108
02:08:51,680 --> 02:08:53,220
我们就可以回家过年了
we all go home.

2109
02:08:59,990 --> 02:09:02,090
伦诺克  你的队伍待命
Lennox, your team is to hold.

2110
02:09:02,130 --> 02:09:03,630
战斗机在各个方向都损失惨重
Strike fighters are getting shot down.

2111
02:09:03,660 --> 02:09:07,400
不  必须要趁现在  飞行员  现在跳  走
No, it's now or never. Pilots, go now! Go!

2112
02:09:07,430 --> 02:09:08,930
等等
Hang on!

2113
02:09:09,300 --> 02:09:10,370
哇哈哈
Chihuahua.

2114
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:13,000
- 你在这里干什么  - 我不知道
- What are you doing here? - I don't know.

2115
02:09:13,270 --> 02:09:15,040
但是你说过我们是家人
But you said we were family.

2116
02:09:15,070 --> 02:09:17,880
不  我不是要你  现在就得把她弄下去
No, I didn't mean... We got to get her off here now.

2117
02:09:18,440 --> 02:09:19,980
现在说不合适了吧
It was probably a bad idea.

2118
02:09:26,180 --> 02:09:27,990
六架飞机出动了
Six birds out of the nest.

2119
02:09:34,460 --> 02:09:35,290
所有鱼鹰就位
All Ospreys clear.

2120
02:09:35,330 --> 02:09:37,200
向目标推进  向目标推进
Push the target, push the target.

2121
02:09:41,200 --> 02:09:42,130
都抓紧了
Hang on!

2122
02:09:42,170 --> 02:09:44,370
- 哇哈哈  - 会没事的  会没事的
- Chihuahua. -It's okay. It's okay.

2123
02:09:54,450 --> 02:09:56,680
所有战机  分散队形  分散队形
All fast movers, distract, distract.

2124
02:09:56,710 --> 02:09:58,380
让敌人远离这些鱼鹰
Keep those enemies away from the Ospreys!

2125
02:09:58,720 --> 02:10:00,320
正前方  敌机
Bogeys dead ahead!

2126
02:10:05,360 --> 02:10:08,060
控制台  分散队形  分散队形
Control, spread it out, spread it out.

2127
02:10:14,200 --> 02:10:16,340
那些战斗机最好分散掉敌方兵力
Those fighters better distract those enemy ships!

2128
02:10:19,240 --> 02:10:21,340
前方敌机来袭  一点钟方向
I got bogeys coming in hot, one o'clock.

2129
02:10:26,310 --> 02:10:27,350
三架敌机  小心
I got three bogeys.

2130
02:10:30,750 --> 02:10:32,220
注意旋翼
Watch the rotor!

2131
02:10:35,350 --> 02:10:37,060
长官  三号机不行了
Sir, bird three just went down!

2132
02:10:57,310 --> 02:10:59,210
那里就是降落区域
There's our landing zone.

2133
02:11:01,510 --> 02:11:03,150
端掉那个火力点
Take that big gun out.

2134
02:11:04,780 --> 02:11:06,990
蝰蛇号  注意那个火力点
Viper Flight, focus on that gun.

2135
02:11:13,820 --> 02:11:15,460
抓紧了  我们要触地了
Hold on, we're going down!

2136
02:11:15,490 --> 02:11:16,430
要硬着陆了
It's gonna be a hard hit.

2137
02:11:16,460 --> 02:11:18,100
别飞出边缘
Don't slide off the edge!

2138
02:11:18,130 --> 02:11:19,330
小心  小心  小心
Brace, brace, brace!

2139
02:11:20,600 --> 02:11:22,400
二号没了  二号没了
Two's down, two's down.

2140
02:11:32,380 --> 02:11:33,480
做好撞击准备
Brace for impact!

2141
02:11:42,250 --> 02:11:44,560
- 快下飞机  - 带着这个伙计
- Out of the bird! - Grab a buddy!

2142
02:11:47,290 --> 02:11:48,390
快下飞机  快
Get out of the bird! Go!

2143
02:11:49,390 --> 02:11:50,430
我们有后援吗
Do we have a Back up?

2144
02:11:55,230 --> 02:11:56,240
敌方战斗机
Enemy fighters!

2145
02:12:32,670 --> 02:12:35,210
那个火力点实在太猛了
That gun emplacement is tearing us apart!

2146
02:12:39,480 --> 02:12:42,350
点火装置在那儿  就在前面
There's the ignition chamber, dead ahead!

2147
02:12:46,890 --> 02:12:48,620
空中掩护过不来  来不了
Air cover not coming. Unable.

2148
02:12:53,220 --> 02:12:54,460
走起  大黄蜂
Let's ride, Bee!

2149
02:12:54,490 --> 02:12:55,630
灭了他们
Let's kick ass!

2150
02:13:02,700 --> 02:13:05,200
向右边弹坑前进  我们走
Push right to the crater! Let's go!

2151
02:13:15,680 --> 02:13:17,680
和探长一起干他们
Pinned down with the Hound!

2152
02:13:20,190 --> 02:13:21,920
没辙了  擎天柱在哪儿呢
No way. Where's Optimus?

2153
02:13:21,950 --> 02:13:23,720
他们说他来不了了
They said he never made it.

2154
02:13:24,390 --> 02:13:25,920
我们遇到一个很猛的火力点
We got the big gun on us!

2155
02:13:25,960 --> 02:13:27,530
我们被压制了
We're pinned down!

2156
02:13:29,230 --> 02:13:31,260
无法接近目标  无法向前推进
Negative to target. Unable to advance.

2157
02:13:33,700 --> 02:13:35,630
快回来  伊莎  - 伊莎
- Get back here, Izzy! - Izzy!

2158
02:13:35,670 --> 02:13:36,940
我很快就回来
I'll be right back!

2159
02:13:36,970 --> 02:13:39,500
这么个烂摊子真是太让人不爽了
It's just a cluster effin' thingamabob!

2160
02:13:45,340 --> 02:13:47,350
小灵通
Sqweeks!

2161
02:13:47,380 --> 02:13:49,550
听着  我需要你过去把那个火力点炸了
Look, I need you to blow that gun up!

2162
02:13:51,950 --> 02:13:53,150
不去
Mommy.

2163
02:13:53,190 --> 02:13:55,220
你个儿又小  长得又丑  没人会看到你过去的
You're small and you're ugly. No one's gonna see you coming.

2164
02:13:56,990 --> 02:13:58,660
快炸了它
Blow it up!

2165
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:06,630
求雨鬼
Infernocus,

2166
02:14:06,960 --> 02:14:09,430
变形吧  干掉他们
transform. Kill them!

2167
02:14:14,740 --> 02:14:16,710
我的弹药不够对付那个家伙
I don't have enough ammo for that thing.

2168
02:14:17,280 --> 02:14:18,480
我来搞定他
I got him!

2169
02:14:35,730 --> 02:14:38,260
大黄蜂和热破不行了  汽车人不行了
Bee and Hot Rod are down! Autobots down!

2170
02:14:38,300 --> 02:14:39,430
擎天柱在哪儿
Where's Prime?

2171
02:14:39,460 --> 02:14:40,600
哎  我滴妈
Ay, chihuahua.

2172
02:14:40,630 --> 02:14:42,530
打不过去呀  将军  火力压制太猛了
It's a no-go, General. We're pinned down!

2173
02:14:42,570 --> 02:14:45,000
好吧  之前的办法都不起作用  对吧
Yeah, well, that hobgoblin stuff didn't work, did it?

2174
02:14:45,040 --> 02:14:47,410
我还有一招  物理手段怎么样
I got a Hail Mary. How about physics?

2175
02:14:47,610 --> 02:14:48,610
好吧  我刚刚做了模拟
Okay, I just did the simulation.

2176
02:14:48,640 --> 02:14:50,710
它就像是泰格·伍兹用九号球杆铲起了
It's like if Tiger Woods was making a big divot

2177
02:14:50,740 --> 02:14:51,740
一大块草皮
with his nine-iron.

2178
02:14:51,780 --> 02:14:53,240
史杜  别挡着  拜托
Stu, out! Come on, man.

2179
02:14:54,580 --> 02:14:55,750
好了  这儿有好一大块都是被那些藤条给拉住的
All right, there's a chunk right here that's held up by thin vines.

2180
02:14:55,780 --> 02:14:57,980
你必须炸断藤条  使用战术核武器炸断藤条
You gotta blow up those vines, use tactical nukes to blow out

2181
02:14:58,020 --> 02:14:59,450
好让它摆动起来
the vines and let it swing.

2182
02:14:59,480 --> 02:15:00,520
然后地心引力起作用
Okay, you let gravity do the rest.

2183
02:15:00,550 --> 02:15:01,620
装置接着就停了
The chamber comes down,

2184
02:15:01,650 --> 02:15:03,520
能量传输停止了  地球就能保住了
the energy transfer stops, and the Earth is saved.

2185
02:15:03,550 --> 02:15:04,560
不用谢
You're welcome.

2186
02:15:04,820 --> 02:15:06,990
给我接战术核武部门
I need tac-nuke authority.

2187
02:15:07,030 --> 02:15:09,490
伦诺克  带着你的人撤离  任务结束了
Lennox team, we are pulling you out. Mission's over.

2188
02:15:09,530 --> 02:15:11,460
给即将抵达的战机指明目标
Laze targets for incoming strike fighters.

2189
02:15:11,500 --> 02:15:12,660
然后听我的撤退指令
Then I'm ordering you to bail.

2190
02:15:12,700 --> 02:15:13,800
收到  有图像了
Roger that. Picture's up.

2191
02:15:14,460 --> 02:15:16,300
我看见了  我看见了
I see it, I see it.

2192
02:15:16,600 --> 02:15:19,500
我们有新目标了  往上三点钟方向
We got a new target! Three o'clock high!

2193
02:15:19,770 --> 02:15:22,470
激光标记新目标给过来的飞机看
Laze the new target for incoming birds.

2194
02:15:22,510 --> 02:15:24,010
他们要把整个玩意儿都移平了
They're gonna bring that whole thing down on us.

2195
02:15:24,040 --> 02:15:25,510
听着  我们不能放弃擎天柱  好吗
Hey! We're not giving up on Prime, okay?

2196
02:15:25,540 --> 02:15:26,640
他会来的
He's gonna be here!

2197
02:15:26,680 --> 02:15:29,010
他们刚刚改了整个计划  我们进不去
They just changed the whole plan. We can't get inside.

2198
02:15:29,050 --> 02:15:31,250
- 什么  - 我们的行动结束了
- What? - The operation is over.

2199
02:15:31,420 --> 02:15:32,480
我们再呆着  就死定了
We stay, we're dead.

2200
02:15:32,520 --> 02:15:33,450
我必须进那儿去
I have to get in there!

2201
02:15:33,490 --> 02:15:35,290
所有人拿好降落伞  我们要撤了
Everybody, grab your chutes, we're bailing!

2202
02:15:39,460 --> 02:15:40,460
你
You.

2203
02:15:48,430 --> 02:15:49,500
打  打  打
Fight, fight, fight.

2204
02:15:49,530 --> 02:15:50,540
开打
Fight's on.

2205
02:15:56,610 --> 02:15:58,510
干得漂亮  小朋友
Good job, little friend.

2206
02:15:58,540 --> 02:16:00,850
- 激光瞄准目标  - 快  快  快啊
- Laze the target! - Move, move, move!

2207
02:16:02,410 --> 02:16:03,450
我们走

It's a new world order now and these guys are calling the shots.

317
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,760
他们只想要一个家 你心里明白得很
All they want is a home, and you know it.

318
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,810
要是逼他们 他们会立马反击
You push them, and they push right back.

319
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,150
探长来了
Hound's in town.

320
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,700
最喜欢早晨打一战了
Love starting the day off with a gunfight.

321
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,450
抱歉我来晚了 我来这劲爆舞会的邀请信
Sorry I'm late. My invitation to this ass-kicking

322
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,220
肯定是寄丢了
must've got lost in the mail!

323
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,980
我和队员要撤了
Me and my crew are rolling out of here.

324
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,920
- 把你的飞机撤走 - 我们走
- Call off your birds. - Let's go.

325
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,430
他们不会动我们的
They're not gonna touch us.

326
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,300
星空一号 撤离 没发现霸天虎的踪迹
All right, Star 1, abort. Negative Decepticon activity.

327
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,850
变形金刚反应部队别动 放下枪
TRF, stand fast. Drop your guns.

328
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:00,400
你确定不开枪吗 我可是你们的目标呢
You sure you don't want to shoot? I'm a big Ol' target.

329
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:01,730
胆小鬼
Wusses.

330
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,480
你到底站哪一边
Whose side are you on?

331
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,600
他们都是坏人
They're all bad.

332
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,380
才不是
No, they're not.

333
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,140
鹰眼 标记他
Eagle Eye, tag him.

334
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,130
我从未见过像它这样的 将军
I've never seen one like it, General.

335
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,010
这个更古老 比擎天柱还老
This one's older, older than Optimus Prime.

336
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,860
路障也在同样的地点被发现
Decepticon Barricade was spotted at that same location.

337
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:32,550
CIA用捕食者监视他有一阵了
CIA's had him under Pred surveillance for a while now.

338
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,180
他一直和一些有趣的对象有来往
Yeah, he's been keeping some interesting company.

339
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,260
法杖被藏在地球上
The staff is hidden on Earth.

340
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,630
充满终极力量的武器
A weapon of ultimate power.

341
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,240
我们会找到它
We'll find this staff.

342
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,330
那声音
That voice.

343
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,750
就像噩梦里一样
I can hear it in my nightmares.

344
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,730
- 威震天 - 有待确认
- Megatron. - Waiting for authentication.

345
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:56,540
就是他
It's him.

346
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,080
威震天大人
Lord Megatron.

347
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,880
别照着我的脸
Get that out of my face.

348
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,900
汇报
Report.

349
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,540
请告诉我你找到了护身符
Tell me you have found the talisman.

350
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:09,050
我看到了 一个濒死骑士交给了人类
I saw it. A dying knight gave it to a human.

351
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,540
但那里有太多变形金刚反应部队的人了
But there was too much TRF firepower.

352
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,640
你居然让护身符被别人夺走了
You let the talisman get away!

353
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,490
我们必须得到它
We must have it!

354
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,410
没有护身符 我们就无法找到法杖
Without the talisman, we cannot find the staff!

355
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,410
我知道谁能带我们找到
I know who can lead us to it.

356
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,900
变形金刚反应部队
The TRF.

357
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,770
总司令命令那武器
Commander in Chief wants that weapon,

358
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:32,610
或者叫它法杖 不论一切都要保护好
or "staff" as he calls it, secured at all cost.

359
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,500
保留你在变形金刚反应部队的卧底身份
Maintain your covert embed with TRF.

360
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,620
长官 他们只是不懂
Sir... They just don't get it.

361
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:40,590
我们与大黄蜂还有变形金刚的历史
Our history with Bee and the Autobots.

362
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,290
我们多希望擎天柱能回来
What we would all give to have Prime back right now.

363
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,390
擎天柱
Optimus Prime.

364
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,730
再次进入塞伯坦
Re-entry Cybertron.

365
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:16,240
我的世界
My World!

366
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:20,340
我的世界怎么了
What has happened to my world?

367
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,480
你的世界濒临死亡
Your world is dying.

368
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,970
我在等你 擎天柱
I've been waiting for you, Optimus.

369
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,190
来见见你的创造者
Come meet your maker.

370
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,320
你是我的创造者
You are my creator?

371
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,160
我是昆塔莎 造物主
I am Quintessa, the Prime of Life.

372
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,650
你对我的家园做了什么
What have you done to my home?

373
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,320
我要杀了你
I will kill you!

374
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,200
你胆敢袭击你的神
You dare to strike your god?

375
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,960
你的战争毁了塞伯坦
Your war doomed Cybertron.

376
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,330
是威震天挑起的战争
Megatron started the war!

377
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:08,240
是你摧毁了你的世界 蠢货
You destroyed your world, you fool.

378
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,640
我完美的造物
My perfect creation.

379
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,490
你去修正这一切
You're going to fix it,

380
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:19,210
否则变形金刚会永远绝迹
or the race of Transformers dies forever.

381
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,600
我创造了你
I made you.

382
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,830
所以要听我的命令
You are mine to command.

383
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,980
怎么跑到这来的
How did you get in here?

384
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,370
主人 我们等了1600年
My lord, that weird thing

385
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:56,010
才发生的奇怪现象出现了
we've been waiting for 1,600 years to happen...

386
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,730
我想这次是真的了
I think it's really happening this time!

387
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,410
骑士们到了
The knight has arrived.

388
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:12,530
护身符被赠与了正确之人
The talisman has been bestowed.

389
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,130
终于 长老 开始了
At last, Cogman. It begins.

390
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,310
我的
Mine!

391
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:51,380
太好了
Yes!

392
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,410
谢谢
Okay. Thanks.

393
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,610
温布利 当时没人盯我啊
Wembly! I was quite open.

394
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,730
没人盯你是有原因的
There's a reason why you're always open.

395
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,440
你一直单身也是有原因的
There's a reason you're always single.

396
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,850
- 什么 - 什么
- What? - What?

397
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:09,590
蠢货
Idiot.

398
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,160
天啊 好吧
Oh, God. Okay.

399
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,290
迟到了 迟到了
So late, so late, so late.

400
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:37,620
公元前484年 发生了一场文明与野蛮间的对决
484 CE. A desperate last stand between civilization and barbarism.

401
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,190
两个世界发生碰撞
Two worlds colliding.

402
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:41,920
只有一个世界能够幸存
Only one survives.

403
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,450
兰斯洛特 珀西瓦尔
Lancelot. Percival.

404
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:45,750
阿瑟王
King Arthur.

405
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:47,190
都是值得尊敬的人
Honorable men.

406
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,510
英勇无畏 体格强健
Brave, muscles sinewed,

407
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,970
大汗淋漓
sweat glistening off their bodies.

408
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:56,920
他们是仅有几位愿意为胜利献出一切的人
A few brave men who were willing to sacrifice all for victory.

409
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,010
听着太不真实了吧 波比
Sound too good to be true, Poppy?

410
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,290
因为都是扯淡
Because it's horseshit.

411
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,330
阿瑟王
Arthur.

412
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:07,540
可能是罗马将军与凯尔特人国王的结合体
A likely composite of a Roman general and a Celtic king.

413
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,300
我们的龙
Our dragon.

414
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:12,170
只是只中世纪的投石机
Just a medieval catapult.

415
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,660
然后梅林
And then we have Merlin,

416
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,190
拥立国王者
our Kingmaker.

417
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:18,430
可能从未存在过
Probably never existed.

418
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,800
问题是
The question is,

419
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:24,930
为什么 为什么我们要给自己编这些故事
why? Why do we tell ourselves these stories?

420
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,270
除了广而告之龙是邪恶之外
Other than the fact that dragons are wicked.

421
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,880
因为那是我们希望相信
It's because we want to believe.

422
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:34,450
希望这些英雄存在于我们的生活中
Believe that we can be heroes in our own lives.

423
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,970
当世界崩塌
When all seems lost,

424
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,890
仅剩下我们几位勇敢的人
a few brave souls, us,

425
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,220
能够拯救我们所知的一切
can save everything we've ever known.

426
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,660
还是说只有龙
Or is it just the dragons?

427
00:26:59,280 --> 00:26:59,970
好吧
Well,

428
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:03,220
不用很久了 老朋友
it won't be much longer now, old friend.

429
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,050
世界末日的迹象就在我们身边
Signs of the end are all around us.

430
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,210
你知道怎么做 是不是
You know what to do, don't you?

431
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:14,310
我们必须重建家园
We must rebuild my home.

432
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,410
有办法拯救你的世界
There is a way to heal your world.

433
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:22,690
我创造力的源泉 法杖
My power of creation, the staff,

434
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:27,410
被我的12位守护骑士偷走
was stolen from me by my 12 guardian knights.

435
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,940
他们背叛了我 将它藏在了地球上
They betrayed me and hid it on Earth.

436
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,140
把它给了你珍视的人类
Gave it to your precious humans.

437
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:39,030
法杖是唯一能让塞伯坦重获生机的途径
The staff is the only way to bring life back to Cybertron.

438
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,160
你帮我去找到它
You are going to find it for me.

439
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:45,680
你想要得到救赎吗 擎天柱
Do you seek redemption, Prime?

440
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,040
想吗
Do you?

441
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:50,100
我的造物主
My maker,

442
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,330
我想
I do.

443
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:59,410
不要害怕 不要憎恨 也不要愤怒
No fear. No hate. No anger.

444
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:05,400
不要害怕 不要憎恨 也不要愤怒
No fear. No hate. No anger.

445
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,970
别碰我 你这个蛆虫
Get off, You maggot!

446
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:12,290
我要杀了你 飞鼠
I will kill you, flying rat!

447
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,630
他还很小 很烦人
He's very little. Very tiring.

448
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,860
坐在这丧失理智
Losing our heads sitting around here.

449
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,870
受够了隐藏
So tired of hiding.

450
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,890
酋长 真是
Hey, Chief! Wow, nice...

451
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,290
天
God!

452
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,970
真是匹好马
Nice horse you got there.

453
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,340
你还真是对这些印第安东西着了迷
You're really getting into this whole Indian thing, huh?

454
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,650
别叫我酋长 我叫谢尔曼
Don't call me Chief. My name is Sherman.

455
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,890
你不是酋长吗
Aren't you the tribal chief?

456
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,240
嗯 但听起来似乎…
Yeah. But from you it sounds...

457
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,100
不知道 有点种族歧视啊
I don't know, vaguely racist.

458
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,450
- 我的巡逻车被偷了 - 什么
- My cruiser got stolen. - What?

459
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,810
- 第二次了 - 太惨了
- Again. - That's terrible!

460
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,720
你猜怎么的
You know what?

461
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,860
事态控制不住了
Shit's getting out of control.

462
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,600
到处都是犯罪
There's crime going on everywhere!

463
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,020
我很多东西都被偷了
A bunch of my stuff got stolen.

464
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,020
别扯淡 凯德 把我车还我
Cut the shit, Cade... And get me my car back.

465
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:16,290
这是汽车人的网站吗？
Is this an Autobot hookup site?

466
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,990
不 我只是梦想去那儿
Nah, I just go here to dream.

467
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,130
看看那个漂亮的底盘
Check out that classy chassis.

468
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,620
看这货箱里的垃圾
Look at the junk in her trunk.

469
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:26,260
闪亮登场
Booyah! Big time.

470
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:29,310
我不该吃了蒂华纳街上所有的车
I should not have eaten all of that Tijuana street machinery.

471

该死 忘了还有个集束炸弹了

小灵通
Sqweeks!

475
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:38,450
下回 剎车轻一点
Next time, ease on the brakes!

476
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:42,030
这是我的风格 我喜欢隆重出场
That's the way I roll. I like to make a statement when I arrive.

477
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:44,210
营地都被你弄上灰了
Well, you're getting dust all over the campus!

478
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,790
这里才不是营地 是垃圾场
This ain't no campus. It's a junkyard!

479
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,600

00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,250
你陷入麻烦了吗
You got in some shit?

484
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,520
都快找上门了
Yeah, neck deep!

485
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,260
凯德 这就是你带大黄蜂出去的下场
Cade, that's what you get for taking the yellow bugger.

486
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,950
你需要找个领导 比如我
You need a leader out there... Like me.

487
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,670
闭嘴 免得我给你带来
Shut up. Before I do some damage

488
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:10,790
无法恢复的伤害
you won't walk away from.

489
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,810
你永远成不了擎天柱
You will never be Optimus Prime.

490
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,040
话太多
You talk too much.

491
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,860
拜托 老兄 百万多岁的传奇战士
Come on, man. Million-year-old legendary warrior

492
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,880
你们却表现的像一堆垃圾狗一样
and you act like a bunch of junkyard dogs!

493
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,680
你惹毛我了
You're starting to piss me off!

494
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,400
快回来 钢锁
Come back here, Grimlock!

495
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,380
转过来 你嘴里有什么
Turn around. What do you got in your mouth?

496
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,120
我发誓 保护你是浪费时间
I swear, I am wasting my time protecting you.

497
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,800
放下巡逻车
Drop the cruiser right now!

498
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:39,100
我知道你吃了谢尔曼的巡逻车
I know you got Chief Sherman's cruiser.

499
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,080
放下
Drop it!

500
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,630
这样才对 吐出来 快
Serves you right. Spit it out! Spit it!

501
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:58,020
别吃车 别吃车
Don't eat cars. Don't eat cars.

502
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,880
回到你的洞去 反省反省
You get back in your hole and think about what you did.

503
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:05,080
就好像是梅西百货感恩节的游行一样热闹啊 吉米
It's like the Macy's Thanks giving Day Parade out here, Jimmy J.

504
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:09,320
你从达科他分账报的一则招人启示中雇佣了我
You hired me from a want ad in the Dakota Penny Ledger.

505
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,350
你以为我有超能力吗
Think that comes with a superpower?

506
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:14,760
那是恐龙 外星恐龙
That is a dinosaur! An alien dinosaur!

507
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,530
广告里可没说
That was not in the ad!

508
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,390
昨天还想吃了我来着
It tried to eat me yesterday.

509
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,650
你想进联邦监狱吗
You want to go to federal prison?

510
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,560
不 我不想进任何监狱
No, no, I don't want to go to any prison.

511
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,720
你肯定要进监狱的
Well, that's where you're gonna go, okay?

512
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,020
因为你是从犯
'Cause you're aiding and abetting.

513
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:26,850
我是逃犯
I'm a fugitive, all right?

514
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,480
我是大老板 你只是我的小喽啰
I'm the big boss, you're my little crimey.

515
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,110
你走后
When you leave,

516
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:32,290
这就变得跟动物世界一样
it becomes the Wild Kingdom out here.

517
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:33,280
我不知道该怎么做
I don't know what to do.

518
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,560
我说过这里是垃圾场
I told you, this is a junkyard.

519
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,120
他们和垃圾融为一体了 仅此而已
They blend in with otherjunk. That's it.

520
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,290
你将我雇佣为国际公司的副总裁
You hired me to be senior vice president of worldwide operations.

521
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:41,120
- 我说过吗 - 你是这么说的
- Did I tell you that? - Yes, that's what you said.

522
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,170
我瞎编的
I made that shit up.

523
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:44,100
请别把我的头衔拿走 凯德
Do not take this title away from me, Cade.

524
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,420
这里不是创业公司 我干这个不是为了赚钱
This is not a startup, okay? I don't do this shit for money.

525
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,470
是为了更远大的事业
It's for the higher cause.

526
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,720
你不是为了赚钱吗
You don't do this shit for the money?

527
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,320
你有什么毛病 你吃什么啊
What's wrong with you? How you gonna eat?

528
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,380
他来这做什么
What's he doing here?

529
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,200
交易员来了
Daytrader's here.

530
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,850
地球上最烦人的变形金刚来了
Here comes the most irritating, annoying Transformer on Earth.

531
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,410
他为了过那个门给了你什么
What did he give you to get past the gate?

532
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:03,320
什么都没给
Nothing!

533
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,480
凯德 他把这个给了他
Hey, Cade. He gave him this.

534
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,890
我从来没见过这个
I've never seen that before in my life.

535
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:10,660
说出来 你想要那外星炸弹
Come on, say it! You wanted the alien blaster.

536
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:13,000
你说过真男人要有好枪
You said a big gun makes a big man.

537
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,610
你知道人类脾气不好 对吧
Hey, you know human beings lose their temper, right?

538
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:16,640
- 你敢 - 过来
- Don't you dare! Hey, hey! - Come here!

539
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,920
- 最糟糕的副总裁… - 停下 停下
- The worst senior vice president... - Stop it! Stop it!

540
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,340
你真男人 你健身了吗
Yeah, you're real tough! What, you been working out?

541
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:23,660
- 我要去炸他 - 绝对的
- Should I frag him? - Yes, definitely frag him.

542
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,060
我听到了 探长
I heard that, Hound.

543
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:25,820
别冲动
Easy!

544
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:29,410
天 你总是靠暴力解决问题
Oh, God. You always resort to violence right off the bat.

545
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:30,450
我喜欢暴力
I love violence.

546
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:33,020
交易员 你怎么会在这儿
Daytrader! The hell are you doing here?

547
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,480
找到你的宇宙飞船了吗
You find our spaceship yet?

548
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,800
我不想在这附近晃悠了
I'm getting tired of hanging around here,

549
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,910
简直是等死
waiting to catch a bullet.

550
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:39,780
一氧化碳 以及或许偶尔的酗汽油
Carbon monoxide, and perhaps a small gasoline drinking problem

551
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:42,590
在子弹打死你之前就能让你死 我的胖友
are gonna kill you long before a bullet, my corpulent comrade.

552
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,460
- 滚 别让我看到你 - 小心 伙计们 停下
- Back off! Get out of my face. - Watch it! Guys, stop!

553
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:47,090
- 你想和探长打一架吗 - 硬汉 没礼貌
- You want to throw down with Hound? - Tough guy, huh? Rude.

554
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:49,310
你来拿这些东西怎么样
How about you trying to carry all this stuff?

555
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:56,880
你就该待在那儿
That's where that's been.

556
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:57,920
拜托
Come on!

557
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,230
看我在布法罗找到了什么
Look what I found in Buffalo.

558

红蜘蛛的头 女士们先生们
Starscream's head, ladies and gentlemen.

559
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:04,640
看我找到了什么 大黄蜂有新音箱了
Look what I got. New voice box for Bee.

560
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,840
这回会成功吗
Is it gonna work this time?

561
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,780
我只有好东西 凯德 好不好
I only got the good stuff, Cade. Come on.

562
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:10,390
听到了吗 大黄蜂 你能说话了 兄弟
You hear that, Bee? You're gonna talk, buddy!

563
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,240
蹲下 大黄蜂
Get down, Bee!

564
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,320
你还有什么
All right, what else you got?

565
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,160
你从哪拿的那垃圾
Where'd you get that piece of junk?

566
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,340
这垃圾堆里会有守护骑士的护身符
A Knight of Iacon talisman in this dump?

567
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,520
绝对不是真的
Nah, it's not real.

568
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:25,120
是吗 不 绝不是真的
Is it? No, definitely not.

569
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,500
嘿 给我 我帮你处理掉
Hey, give it to me, I'll take it off you.

570
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,640
你以为我不知道这玩意是什么吗 有多重要
You think I don't know what the hell this is? How valuable?

571
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,970
但我知道这肯定很重要 因为
But I know it's something, because it's got you

572
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:31,740
你对这玩意垂涎欲滴 你个邋遢鬼
licking your chops, you skank.

573
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,270
说话真伤人 凯德
Words hurt, Cade.

574
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,780
一共有七个 我数过的
There are exactly seven... Count them.

575
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,600
七个末日来临的征兆
Seven signs of the apocalypse.

576
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,230
那里的那个护身符出现就是第一个
And that talisman showing up here is numero uno.

577
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:41,000
如果那个可爱的铁饼是真的
If that fancy pancake was real,

578
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,970
我会抓起宇宙飞船 然后让这个脏兮兮的星球灰飞烟灭
I'd grab the spaceship and blow this dirtball planet.

579
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:46,450
好吧 我得给自己涂点油了
All right, I'm gonna go slather myself in oil.

580
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:48,780
如果你感觉不适的话 漂移 转过去
Turn your back, Drift, if it offends your sensibilities.

581
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,880
那种东西可是很难视而不见的
Now that is something you can't unsee.

582
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,930
我不太理解你在说什么
I barely understand what's coming out of your mouth.

583
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:53,970
嘿 先生
Hey, mister!

584
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:55,540
不是吧
This isn't happening.

585
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,310
你不能待在这里 孩子 我这已经不少流浪汉了
You cannot stay here, kid. I got enough strays.

586
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:01,220
我不是小孩 我很有用的 我会修东西
I'm not a kid! I'm useful. I fix shit.

587
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,020
- 那太棒了 - 比别人都厉害
- Yeah, good for you. - Better than anyone.

588
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,460
而且我有名字
And I have a name, you know.

589
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,340
是伊莎贝拉 有字母Z的那个
It's Izabella. Izabella with a Z.

590
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,740
我才不关心带不带Z或者颜文字 还是美元符号神马的
I don't care if it's a Z, an emoji, or a dollar sign, all right?

591
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:09,920
好吗 我这里可没地方给…
This is no place for...

592
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,450
回家吧 拜托了
Just go home. Please.

593
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,060
我没有家
I don't got a home.

594
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,620
而且他们
And they...

595
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:18,190
而且他们刚刚杀了
They just killed

596
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,930
我最后一位可称为家人的生灵
the last thing that I called family.

597
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:23,580
所以 不
So no,

598
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:27,360
我哪也不去
I'm not going anywhere.

599
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:32,420
我想留下 并且和他们对抗
I want to stay and I want to fight them.

600
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,650
你没法与他们对抗 你也不可能打败他们
You can't fight them, and you can't beat them.

601
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,880
好吗 整个世界都支持他们
All right? They have the support of the entire world.

602
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,670
而你 你只是个孩子
You, you're a kid.

603
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,780
你怎么还跟着我
Why are you still following me?

604
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,430
T
T!

605
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,400

嘿 先生 你的拖车着火了
Hey! Mister! Your trailer's on fire.

607
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,410
嘿 到转角那
Hey, corner.

608
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,850
- 我的天啊 - 伙计 我为你自豪
- Oh, my God. - Buddy! I'm proud of you.

609
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,020
但是你得去外面喷火 好吗
I know, but you gotta do it outside now, okay?

610
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,580
不然你会把这里都烧没了的
You could burn this whole place down.

611
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,970
我知道 但是你现在能量过剩 好吗
I know, but you're coming into your power now, all right?

612
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:10,020
所以你要喷火 不
So you gotta blow the flames... No.

613
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,190
特里 帮我拿个啤酒好吗
Terry, get me a beer, will ya?

614
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,140
嘿 伙计们 你们得停下
Hey, guys, you gotta cut the crap.

615

你彷佛浸没在他们的臭气中 恶心

她过来了 看她麻花辫一摇一摇的霸气劲
Here she go. Look at her, walking all strong with pigtails.

915
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:42,070
下地狱吧
Go to hell!

916
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,120
这个星球就是地狱
This planet is hell.

917

你胳膊上那是什么
What's that on your arm?

918
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:49,520
- 放下他 - 妈的

919
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,140
你以为我怕你吗 傻瓜

- 嘿 停下 - 凯德·伊格尔

我需要那个护身符
I need that talisman!

922
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,550
我们不搞这种自杀式行动
We don't do this kamikaze shit.

923
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:07,600
你想跑过去朝一个霸天虎大喊大叫吗
You wanna go out there and start screaming at a Decepticon?

924
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,860
- 抓住那些可憎的生物 - 我去抓他们

打到你了
Gotcha!

928
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:41,440
还有他的胖脑袋
And his fat head.

929
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,390
不能比这更棒了
Don't get any better than that.

930
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:44,420
马上撤退
Drift, now!

这个计划完蛋了
That plan went to shit.

934

你就这一个计划吗
That's the only plan you got?

935
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,900
蹲下 蹲下 蹲下
Get down, get down, get down!

936
00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:05,410
- 那是什么 - 变形金刚反应部队

937
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,610
我们得进屋 来 跑起来
We gotta get inside. Come on. Run.

938
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,410
这些人应该去抓捕恐怖分子
This is supposed to hunt terrorists,

939
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:11,960
不是美国纳税人
not tax-paying Americans!

940
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,380
也不是说我纳税 但是…
Not that I pay taxes, but...

941
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:15,990
老威 威震天
Yo, Meg! M-tron!

942
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:19,680
别玩了 快点 这里只有我吗
Stop playing. Come on. Am I the only one in here?

943
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:25,460
这可不对
This ain't right.

944
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,130
- 我们在这里很安全 - 总有一个领头的
- We're safe in here. - There's always one in charge.

945
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:37,000
像在芝加哥那时候 像妈妈一样的人
Just like back in Chicago, like a mother.

946
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,120

Hide in that room!

950

快 快 快
Come on, come on, come on!

951
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:15,900
我没穿兜帽就为了不被枪击
I left the 'hood to not get shot

952
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,110
现在我被子弹袭击
and now I'm getting shot.

953
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:18,890
这是史上最差的工作
This is the worst job ever.

954
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:21,030
这个工作有医保吗
Does this job even have healthcare?

955
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:22,230
没有 是吧
It doesn't, do it?

956
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:24,480
你试试自己治疗子弹伤
You try treating a bullet wound by yourself.

957
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,200
小心
Watch out!

958
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:30,310

964
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:18,900
它用的是脸部识别
It's using facial recognition.

965
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:21,310
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

966

没有洞 没有血 什么都没有
There's no hole, there's no blood, no nothing.

- 没有洞 - 你能站起来吗

别逞英雄了
Stop trying to act like a hero.

矮精灵很小 浑身绿色 还是爱尔兰的
Leprechauns are tiny, green and Irish,

怎么 然后就跟一个疯子忍者管家走吗

不过是些旧书罢了

对于刚才的事我感到很抱歉 你看
I'm awfully sorry about that, but you see,

1156

他以为现在还是1918或者1914年 大概就那段时间
he thinks it's still the year 1918 or 1914. Something like that.

壕沟与泥泞中
Trenches and mud and death

1162
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:52,770
到处都是血迹和成堆的尸体 着实令人伤感
and gore and all that. It's terribly sad.

1163
01:06:52,770 --> 01:06:55,160
离蒂珀雷里还远 家乡遥遥无际
"It's a long way to Tipperary, it's a long way to go."

1164
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:57,670
那真的是太残酷了
Yeah, but it's... It's terrible!

1165
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,420
太惨烈了 你知道吗 但是当时
I mean, so sad, you know? But then, I mean...

1166
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:03,490
不是吗 我是说 这种迟发性的
Isn't it? I mean, this late onset of, well...

1167
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:05,940
机器人痴呆
Robot dementia.

1168
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:07,520
得了之后可不好过
It's not at all pretty.

1169
01:07:09,810 --> 01:07:11,950
我不知道你那烟管里抽得是什么
I don't know what you're smoking in that pipe, man, but...

1170
01:07:12,110 --> 01:07:13,200
这里到底是怎么回事
What's going on here?

1171
01:07:13,790 --> 01:07:16,050
你是把我拉到什么变形金刚的养老院了吗
Did you drag me to some Transformer retirement home?

1172
01:07:16,050 --> 01:07:18,100
听着 最好有人能给我解释一下 不然我可要走了
Look, somebody better start talking, or I'm outta here.

1173
01:07:18,530 --> 01:07:19,250
好的
Okay.

1174
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:21,080
大黄蜂
Bumblebee?

1175
01:07:21,330 --> 01:07:23,730
我们只在我小时候见过一面
We only met when I was a little boy in short pants.

1176
01:07:23,730 --> 01:07:24,560
我大概那么高
I must have been that tall.

1177
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:26,790
可能高一点 可能矮一点 我不太记得了
Maybe taller. Or maybe shorter, I can't remember.

1178
01:07:26,790 --> 01:07:29,350
- 但从不会忘记别人的长相 - 大黄蜂 你认识这家伙么？
- But never forget a face. - Bee, you know this guy?

1179
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:31,120
我不认识你
I don 't... with you.

1180
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:31,850
好吧
Yes.

1181
01:07:31,850 --> 01:07:32,980
我们来看看这个东西
Let's have a look at this thing.

1182
01:07:33,430 --> 01:07:35,130
可以吗 这很有趣
Please. Very interesting.

1183
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:37,300
没错
Yes.

1184
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:42,050
你保守这个秘密这么长时间 知道那是真的
You keep a secret for so long, knowing it to be true,

1185
01:07:42,050 --> 01:07:44,180
然而 内心深处
and yet, deep down inside,

1186
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:45,570
你却产生疑问
you begin to wonder,

1187
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,770
我的人生被荒废了吗
"Has my life been wasted?"

1188
01:07:49,890 --> 01:07:52,160
你有没有过那样的感觉 凯德先生
Have you ever felt like that, Mr. Cade?

1189
01:07:53,970 --> 01:07:55,180
叫我凯德就好
It's just Cade.

1190
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:58,480
听着 老前辈 我现在可没那么多耐心陪你猜谜语
Look, old timer, I don't have a ton of patience for riddles right now.

1191
01:07:58,910 --> 01:08:01,620
没错 但是你想要知道 不是吗 老兄
Yes, but you want to know, don't you, "dude",

1192
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:03,960
他们为什么不断来到这里
why they keep coming here.

1193
01:08:04,850 --> 01:08:07,590
来到地球 对吗
To Earth. Right?

1194
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:13,300
我很欣赏掐准时机的人
I do so love perfect timing.

1195
01:08:16,530 --> 01:08:18,820
多靓的车啊
What a bitchin' car she is!

1196
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:28,210
不 不 别跑 小姐
No, no, no, little lady.

1197
01:08:28,210 --> 01:08:30,530
你为什么非要这个样子呢 为什么
Why do you have to be like that? Pourquoi?

1198
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:34,590
这是因为她被绑架了
So, is this a kidnapping sort of situation

1199
01:08:34,590 --> 01:08:36,640
还是因为 她第一次见变形金刚
or her first Transformer experience?

1200
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,230
其实二者都有
It's both, really.

1201
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:40,180
别再打我了
Do not hit me again!

1202
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:43,600
但是她的战斗或逃跑反应很不错
But she does have a rather nice fight-or-flight response.

1203
01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:46,510
她可真难搞

01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:02,240
安静点就行了
Just be quiet.

1348
01:16:02,670 --> 01:16:03,810
有什么毛病
What's the matter with you?

1349
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:06,080
要是让我找到他脖子我一定掐死他
If I could find his neck, I'd strangle him.

1350
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:09,250
这是阿瑟王的东西
This belonged to King Arthur himself.

1351
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:13,910
传说最后的骑士在某天会注定
Now, legend held that one last knight would someday be chosen

1352
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:16,500
接受使命为拯救世界顽强而战
and the struggle to save the world would begin.

1353
01:16:17,190 --> 01:16:19,190
看起来 凯德先生
It would appear, Mr. Cade,

1354
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:22,850
你是最后的骑士
that that last knight is you.

1355
01:16:25,490 --> 01:16:26,310
什么
What?

1356
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:28,700
你的意思是他穿越了整个宇宙就为了找我吗
You're saying he traveled the whole universe to find me?

1357
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:29,840
不 不是特意来找你
No, not you specifically.

1358
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:32,220
不是来找这个德州来的失败发明家
Not a failed inventor from the state of Texas.

1359
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:33,260
才不是
No, God forbid.

1360
01:16:34,810 --> 01:16:35,660
停
Stop it!

1361
01:16:37,190 --> 01:16:37,810
怎么了
What?

1362
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:39,600
你要是不停下
You know, if you don't stop it,

1363
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:42,750
我会用一个小盒子装你送回塞伯坦
I will send you back to Cybertron in a little tiny box.

1364
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:43,490
我好怕
Scary.

1365
01:16:43,490 --> 01:16:44,950
我不是失败的发明家
I am not a failed inventor.

1366
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:48,840
他要找的是符合骑士精神的人 凯德先生
No, he meant the qualities of a knight, Mr. Cade.

1367
01:16:49,370 --> 01:16:52,130
薇薇安小姐 骑士精神 请说一下
Miss Viviane, the qualities of a knight, if you please?

1368
01:16:52,130 --> 01:16:55,820
骑士精神是 纯净的心灵 勇猛 荣誉感 贞洁 正直
Qualities of a knight, purity of heart, valor, honor, virtue, integrity.

1369
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:57,140
我有这些品质
I have those.

1370
01:16:57,140 --> 01:16:58,420
最重要的是…
And most importantly...

1371
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:00,560
- 他是否纯贞 - 被人追吗
- Is he chaste? - Chased?

1372
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:02,280
老兄 我被你那奇怪的伙计一直追
Dude, I was getting chased when your little weirdo buddy

1373
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:03,620
直到把我带到这来
brought me over here on the plane.

1374
01:17:04,350 --> 01:17:05,390
纯贞
"Chaste".

1375
01:17:05,530 --> 01:17:06,880
纯 贞
C-H-A-S-T-E.

1376
01:17:07,220 --> 01:17:07,870
贞
"T".

1377
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:08,740
禁欲
Celibate?

1378
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:10,730
我知道 我只是逗你们
Yeah, I know... I was making a joke.

1379
01:17:10,730 --> 01:17:12,050
你以为我不会吗
You don't think I know how to spell?

1380
01:17:12,050 --> 01:17:13,540
- 我知道他的意思 - 当然了
- I know what he meant. - Sure you were.

1381
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:15,880
真的吗 凯德先生
No whoopee, Mr. Cade?

1382
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:18,100
很久没有了
It's been a while.

1383
01:17:18,590 --> 01:17:21,310
很久是多久 一周 一个月 一年
Well, how long's "a while"? A week? A month? A year?

1384
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:22,860
不关你事
None of your business.

1385
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:24,490
我们得问你这个问题
Well, we need to ask you the question.

1386
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:26,390
很久就是很久
A while!

1387
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:29,360
这是什么？
What is this?

1388
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:30,740
这又是英国人的毛病吗
Is that, like, another English thing?

1389
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:33,120
不 只是我们好奇
No, no. Just a curious thing.

1390
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:34,510
也许我守身如玉呢
Well, maybe I'm saving myself.

1391
01:17:34,510 --> 01:17:36,470
你为什么要守身如玉 老头
What are you saving yourself for, old age?

1392
01:17:36,470 --> 01:17:38,080
你这个英国女人 闭嘴
You, English lady, shut it.

1393
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,810
这是什么 地图吗
What is this? Some sort of a map?

1394
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:44,580
这桌子来自塞伯坦
This table is from Cybertron.

1395
01:17:44,580 --> 01:17:47,730
这是我研究了一阵子的地图
It's a puzzle I've been working on for some time.

1396
01:17:47,970 --> 01:17:49,430
其实研究一生了
My entire life, actually.

1397
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:51,940
这些字符是什么意思
And what do these glyphs say about it?

1398
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:53,210
古塞伯坦语
They're Olde Cybertronian.

1399
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:56,280
从宇宙低声传来的咒语
A mantra whispered through the cosmos.

1400
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:00,900
等下
Wait a minute.

1401
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:02,970
我听过
I heard that before.

1402
01:18:04,470 --> 01:18:06,980
船上的骑士说过 是什么意思
A knight on a ship. What does it mean?

1403
01:18:07,330 --> 01:18:10,270
用你最后一口气 保护好法杖
"With your dying breath, protect the staff."

1404
01:18:11,190 --> 01:18:12,960
这太荒唐了
Okay, this is ridiculous.

1405
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:20,640
他们为它起了名字
They had their name for it.

1406
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:22,260
我们也有
We have ours.

1407
01:18:23,030 --> 01:18:24,290
梅林之杖
The staff of Merlin.

1408
01:18:24,590 --> 01:18:28,470
外星人赠与他的 融合了他的基因
Bequeathed to him by an alien race. Fused with his DNA.

1409
01:18:28,930 --> 01:18:32,820
因此只有他才有打开它里面外星力量的钥匙
So that only he would have the key to unlock its alien power.

1410
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,710
也就是如今的
Or as they knew it in those days,

1411
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:37,700
魔法
magic.

1412
01:18:40,150 --> 01:18:43,170
这支法杖葬在了梅林身边
The staff was buried with Merlin's body.

1413
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,130
我们藏了一千年
A thousand years we've kept it hidden.

1414
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:49,140
若是落入坏人手中 意味着
If it ever fell into the wrong hands, it would mean

1415
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:53,720
我们所热爱的一切便会毁灭
the imminent destruction of everything we know and love.

1416
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:58,240
12位守护骑士合体变成了龙来保护它
The 12 Guardian Knights combined into a mighty dragon to protect it.

1417
01:18:58,240 --> 01:18:59,940
现在它陷入了大麻烦
And now it is in great danger.

1418
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:03,160
威震天 他在找它
Megatron. He was after this.

1419
01:19:03,220 --> 01:19:04,570
所以大战要来临了
So the battle is upon us.

1420
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:06,510
这就是他们在这的原因 为什么他们一直来地球
It is why they're here, why they keep coming to Earth.

1421
01:19:06,510 --> 01:19:09,420
我们必须在太迟之前拿走法杖
And we must claim the staff before it is too late.

1422
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:10,850
等下 干嘛
Wait. We what?

1423
01:19:10,930 --> 01:19:13,430
只有一位梅林的直系后代
Only a direct descendant of Merlin himself

1424
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:17,000
能够挥动这拥有绝对权力的法器
can wield this instrument of absolute power.

1425
01:19:17,970 --> 01:19:20,050
而你 薇薇安小姐
And you, Miss Viviane,

1426
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:23,380
是梅林在地球上最后一位后裔
are Merlin's last descendant here on Earth, and as such,

1427
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:25,550
因此 你是我们最后的希望
you are our last hope.

1428
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:27,440
等下 往回一点
Okay, wait. Go back.

1429
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:29,860
你是说我和魔法师梅林有血缘关系吗
You're saying that I'm related to the wizard Merlin?

1430
01:19:36,290 --> 01:19:37,520
有点惊讶 是不是
Bit of a shock, isn't it?

1431
01:19:38,530 --> 01:19:42,470
只有你知道法杖在哪 由你父亲传给你
Only you know the staff's location, imparted to you by your father.

1432
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,200
他肯定会留下线索 对吧
He had to leave a clue, didn't he?

1433
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:46,690
你确定吗
Are you sure?

1434
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:49,070
看她这样似乎不知道法杖在哪
She doesn't have that "I know where the staff is" look.

1435
01:19:49,070 --> 01:19:51,890
听着 我父亲唯一告诉我的是
Listen, the only thing that my father imparted to me

1436
01:19:51,890 --> 01:19:53,460
离开他的书房
was to get out of his study.

1437
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:56,120
"两个世界碰撞 只有一个存活"
"Two worlds colliding, only one survives."

1438
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:59,330
这是你的原话 只是你下课了
Your words exactly. Only lecture time is over.

1439
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:01,300
你就是为此而生的
You were born for this.

1440
01:20:02,370 --> 01:20:04,710
这是他们来这之前自己星球的最后画面
This is the latest image of their world coming here.

1441
01:20:05,170 --> 01:20:06,930
而你们都挡了他们的路
And you're all that stand in its way.

1442
01:20:07,090 --> 01:20:09,130
所以你们必须快点找到法杖
So you'd better find that staff quickly.

1443
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:10,160
快

1444

01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,560
包围封锁城堡
Surround the castle and lock it down.

1446
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:18,980
军情六处和变形金刚反应部队来了
MI6 and TRF are here!

1447
01:20:19,530 --> 01:20:20,690
撤退 快
Move it! Go!

1448
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,330
长老 带我去伦敦好吗
Cogman, get me to London, okay?

1449
01:20:27,050 --> 01:20:28,940
- 伪装车准备好了吗 - 快点
- The decoy car is ready? - Hurry along.

1450
01:20:31,650 --> 01:20:33,520
交给我
I got 'em, boys!

1451
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:39,220
快点 快走
Hurry, move! Quick, quick, quick!

1452
01:20:40,870 --> 01:20:41,870
大黄蜂 带我们离开
Get us out of here, Bee.

1453
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,830
快离开 我的武器能停止时间
Get out of here! My weapon will stop the time!

1454
01:20:59,710 --> 01:21:02,650
爱因斯坦估计都会被逗乐了
Einstein would've been tickled pink. Foo-Foo!

1455
01:21:05,410 --> 01:21:07,260
快点 这边 这边走
Quick, this way, this way! Hurry!

1456
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:10,110
霰弹枪 我要霰弹枪
Shotgun. I call shotgun.

1457
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:21,010
直升机入境 可以安全降落
Inbound helos, you are clear to land.

1458
01:21:21,950 --> 01:21:23,620
伦诺克斯上校刚到
Colonel Lennox just hit the deck.

1459
01:21:25,690 --> 01:21:28,110
我是桑托斯 美国分部队长 有什么消息
This is Santos, Team Leader USA. What you got?

1460

变形金刚反应部队飞艇上路了
TRF airship on the way.

1461
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:42,170
在后面等我
Meet me around back, Bee.

1462
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,110
我不会玩
I suck at this game!

1463
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:48,300
你咬手指的时候就出卖了自己
When you bite your nails, you give everything away.

1464
01:21:48,370 --> 01:21:49,120
妈
Mum?

1465
01:21:50,610 --> 01:21:53,080

1466

Do you have a dungeon?

1471
01:22:01,050 --> 01:22:03,380
老天 手像个粗糙的老树皮
Oh, my goodness! Hands like rough old maple.

He looks hard as wood.

1473

别碰他 我去换衣服
Don't touch him. I'm gonna go and get changed.

1474
01:22:07,490 --> 01:22:10,930
我收到一通三一图书馆的愤怒清洁工来的电话
I got a call from a very irate janitor at Trinity Library.

1475
01:22:11,450 --> 01:22:12,320

You're late.

1476
01:22:12,570 --> 01:22:14,370
确实 如他们所说 陷入了小麻烦
We are, as they say, in a bit of a pickle.

1477

现在别搞我
Do not mess with me at this moment!

1478
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,300
天气很热 我脾气也很爆
It's hot, and I am on a short fuse.

1479
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,380
快点 去图书馆
Quick! Get to the library!

1480
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:25,250
这场追逐真是让我紧张极了
This chasing is stressing me out.

1481

军情六处和变形金刚反应部队要找到我们了 我们得快点
MI6 and TRF are gonna find us. We got to hurry.

1482

我父亲东西很多
My dad had a lot of stuff.

1483
01:22:34,890 --> 01:22:36,530
那找到法杖的地点
So, finding the staff's location...

1484
01:22:36,530 --> 01:22:37,840
是什么意思 我们在找 什么
What does that mean? We're looking for, like, what?

1485
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:40,020
地图 或者信件 书 或者
Like, a map, or a letter, or books, or...

1486
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:43,080
天呐 在这里找得找一年
Holy shit! It'll take a year to find something in here.

1487
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:45,550
不知道上哪找那该死的法杖
I don't know where to find this bloody staff.

1488
01:22:45,550 --> 01:22:48,240
看看这个小假马 没准塞在它屁股里之类的
Look at this little fake horse. Probably stuffed in its butt or something.

1489
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:49,770
男人就爱干蠢事
Guys do stupid stuff like that.

1490
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:53,060
上面发生了什么
What is going on up there?

1491
01:22:54,350 --> 01:22:55,810
你查照片后面了吗
You checking behind pictures?

1492
01:22:55,810 --> 01:22:57,390
撕了吧 使劲撕
Just rip it. Rip it apart!

- 我拿不出来 - 太好了
- I can't get it out. - Great.

1496
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:06,660
我的天 攒了这么多东西
Oh, my God. Such a hoarder.

1497
01:23:09,310 --> 01:23:11,010
就好像里面进了人猿泰山一样闹
It's like having Tarzan in the house.

1498
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:12,420
慢点
Slow down.

1499
01:23:13,830 --> 01:23:15,550
- 我去看一眼 - 别去

想得美 先让我加入

1503
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:28,930
当维特维坎人 必须与众不同
To be a Witwiccan, you have to be a special person.

1504
01:23:28,990 --> 01:23:30,190

You, sir, are not.

1505

让我进去我就告诉你 现在马上
Read me into the club and I'll tell you. Right here, now.

电话里吗 这太野蛮了
Over the phone? That is absolutely barbaric.

1507

就在电话里 快点 英国佬
Over the phone. Do it, Englishman!

1508

作为第12位福尔杰伯爵 以神圣的阿瑟王
As the 12th Earl of Folgan, by the power imbued

1509
01:23:40,930 --> 01:23:42,680

1510
01:23:42,830 --> 01:23:44,710
以及他的圆桌骑士联盟为名

1512
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:49,620
- 进入 - 接受 不是进入
- Entrance into... -"Admittance", not "entrance"!

1513
01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:50,920
别唬我 说正确的词

1516
01:23:58,200 --> 01:23:59,320

Hurry, man, they're dissolving scrotums. Let's go.

我正赶过去呢 听你讲话真容易犯迷糊
I'm going! I'm going! It's very confusing talking to you.

1520
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:06,820
动作快点 老头
Come on, old man, get there!

1521

我们一起去沙滩给你那双大白腿晒晒黑
Let's get your pale-ass legs and go to the beach.

1523
01:24:10,930 --> 01:24:13,550
我有正事 我保证只要五分钟
I'm working here, all right? Five minutes, I swear!

1524
01:24:13,550 --> 01:24:15,860
你总是说五分钟 也就是不的意思
You always say five minutes. That means no.

1525
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:18,610
快去找罗德里戈和胡里奥开始准备
Just go get Rodrigo and Julio and get the game started.

1526
01:24:18,610 --> 01:24:20,060

I hate Rodrigo.

1527
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:21,480
还有十分钟我就去找你
I'll set and bump with you in 10 minutes.

1528
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:23,140
拜托 我还没忙完呢
Okay, come on, I'm in the middle of something.

1529
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:24,080
我回来了
Okay, back.

1530
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:27,720
早在中世纪 这些魔法师就清楚 末日会何时降临
They knew way back in the Dark Ages where the end would begin.

1531
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:29,890
塞伯坦与地球共同存在
There is Cybertron and there is Earth.

1532
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:31,880
只是他们从来不叫这里"地球"
Only they don't call it Earth at all, they never did.

1533
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:33,130
他们用另一个名字来称呼
They called it something else.

1534
01:24:33,130 --> 01:24:34,960
总有一个会被另一个吸干
One will suck the other dry,

1535
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:38,420
像巨大的吸管一样 直到只剩一方
a giant succubus, until only one remains.

1536
01:24:41,210 --> 01:24:42,890
地球是宇宙之王
Earth is Unicron.

1537
01:24:42,890 --> 01:24:46,600
某天他会扬起角去对抗疯女昆塔莎
One day his horns will rise to fight the mad goddess Quintessa.

1538
01:24:47,730 --> 01:24:50,760
她会牺牲我们的星球 让自己的星球复活
She will end our planet to resurrect her own.

1539
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:52,670
我们走 快
Let's go. Hurry!

1540
01:24:52,670 --> 01:24:54,130
- 天啊 - 长老 快走
- My lord. - Cogman, go!

1541
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:56,800
- 告诉我在哪 - 我刚给了你
- Tell me where it goes down. - I just Dropped it to you.

1542
01:24:56,860 --> 01:24:59,090
角是找到法杖地点的关键
The horns are the key to the location.

1543
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:00,770
为什么他们胡乱地散落在
Why are they spread out all over the Earth

1544
01:25:00,770 --> 01:25:02,210
地球 答案是 并没有
in a jumble? The answer, they aren't.

1545
01:25:02,210 --> 01:25:04,500
失控与大自然让他们分裂开来
Time and Mother Nature pulled them apart.

1546
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:06,280
那是盘古大陆 超大陆
That's Pangaea. The supercontinent.

1547
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:08,010
和圆桌的形状一样
It's the same shape on the Round Table.

1548
01:25:08,010 --> 01:25:09,370
福尔杰 看一眼
Take a gander, Folgers,

1549
01:25:09,370 --> 01:25:12,190
在那完美的圆形中心有什么
at what's smack in the center of that perfect circle.

1550
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:14,820
- 聪明 - 那是巨石阵
- Genius! - That's Stonehenge!

1551
01:25:14,820 --> 01:25:16,550
史上最伟大的谜团
One of the greatest mysteries of the ages.

1552
01:25:16,550 --> 01:25:18,370
直到现在都没人知道它的作用
No one understood its purpose until now.

1553
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:21,360
- 除了我 没人 - 那就是开始的地方
- No one. Except me. - That's where it all begins.

1554
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:23,320
你是大佬 快采取措施
You're the man behind the man. Do something.

1555
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:25,380
交给我 西蒙斯兄弟 别担心
I'll handle it, Brother Simmons, fear not.

1556
01:25:25,380 --> 01:25:26,530
我从来没有兄弟
I never had a brother.

1557
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:29,240
感觉真好
Feels nice.

1558
01:25:29,700 --> 01:25:31,300
去沙滩咯 准备好了吗
Beach time! Ready?

1559
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:37,660
"薇薇安跟着梅林"
"Viviane followed Merlin."

1560
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:40,020
那是什么意思
What does that mean?

1561
01:25:40,820 --> 01:25:42,080
我的秘密储藏间
My secret cupboard!

1562
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:48,080
好了
Okay, okay.

1563
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:50,130
"薇薇安跟着梅林"
"Viviane followed Merlin."

1564
01:25:50,210 --> 01:25:53,380
只有梅林才能挥动魔法杖
Only Merlin could wield the magic staff.

1565
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:56,060
梅林和小女孩 当然了
Merlin and little girls, of course.

1566
01:26:00,830 --> 01:26:02,980
海军博物馆 法杖肯定在那
Navy Museum, that's got to be where the staff is.

1567
01:26:03,010 --> 01:26:04,660
天 原来一直都在我手中
It was in my hands all along.

1568
01:26:08,860 --> 01:26:10,080
A队 快去 快 快
Alpha team, go, go, go.

1569
01:26:11,070 --> 01:26:12,910
- 英国变形金刚反应部队 - 快走
- British TRF! - Come on!

1570
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:15,780
我投降
I surrender.

1571
01:26:17,090 --> 01:26:19,070
主人 变形金刚应对小组正在紧追不舍
My lord, TRF is on our tail.

1572
01:26:19,850 --> 01:26:21,990
你怎么非把诱饵车停得那么远
Why'd you park the decoy car so far away?

1573
01:26:21,990 --> 01:26:23,540
你真是个蠢货
You are a fusspotl

1574
01:26:24,540 --> 01:26:26,740
好啦 别让咱俩被抓了 长老
Good. Don't let us get caught, Cogman.

1575
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:29,480
我就擅长这个 大人
My speciality, my lord.

1576
01:26:47,730 --> 01:26:49,680
见鬼 你也不是非得杀人啊
Damn! You don't have to kill people.

1577
01:26:56,140 --> 01:26:57,140
闪开
Get out of the way!

1578
01:27:00,510 --> 01:27:02,600
这倒提醒我了 艾格尼丝打了个电话过来
Which reminds me, Agnes called.

1579
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:05,530
她想知道你今晚有没有空跟她共度良辰
Wondered if you're available for a bit of a snuggle this evening.

1580
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:08,510
我倒是很愿意 但你看我像有空的样子吗
I'd love a snuggle with Agnes. Do I look available?

1581
01:27:18,950 --> 01:27:20,710
- 闪开 混蛋 别挡路 - 自杀式撞击来了
- Move, bitch! Get out of my way! - Kamikaze pilot!

1582
01:27:20,710 --> 01:27:22,500
闪开 混蛋 别挡我的路
Move, bitch! Get out of my way!

1583
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:26,170
- 你好 是我 - 海军博物馆
- Hello. Yes. - Navy Museum.

1584
01:27:27,780 --> 01:27:29,820
皇家海军博物馆 我就知道
Royal Navy Museum. I knew it!

1585
01:27:34,910 --> 01:27:36,770
大黄蜂 我来吸引警察
Bee, I'm gonna divert the cops!

1586
01:27:39,870 --> 01:27:41,090
一个霸天虎已经被
A Decepticon has been seen...

1587
01:27:41,090 --> 01:27:42,280
你说霸天虎是什么意思
What do you mean, Decepticon?

1588
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:46,740
- 刺激的来了 - 还搞刺激的啊
- Here's where it gets intense. - More intense?

1589
01:27:58,730 --> 01:27:59,470
大黄蜂
Bee?

1590
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:07,810
该死的 他们把我们包围了
Goddamn, they're all around us

1591
01:28:07,810 --> 01:28:10,180
而我的路怒症又要犯了
and I just have so much road rage!

1592
01:28:10,180 --> 01:28:12,030
释放怒火吧 就这样
Actualize the rage. That's it!

1593
01:28:13,620 --> 01:28:14,930
想尝尝嘛
You want some?

1594
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:19,230
长老 炸了他们
Cogman, blast them!

1595
01:28:31,790 --> 01:28:32,690
好样的
Good boy.

1596
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:37,160
这是个死胡同
It's a one-way street!

1597
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:38,740
车又不是我开的 是他开的
I'm not driving. He's driving.

1598
01:28:41,140 --> 01:28:41,890
不
No!

1599
01:28:47,140 --> 01:28:48,800
- 大黄蜂 往右边 有个跟屁虫 - 快走
- Bee, head right, haul ass! - Go!

1600
01:29:03,930 --> 01:29:06,000
只有这样你才能进大联盟
That's how you get to the big leagues.

1601
01:29:08,990 --> 01:29:10,070
真疼
That hurt.

1602
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:13,600
怎么回事？你疯了吗
What the hell? You are out of your mind!

1603
01:29:18,310 --> 01:29:19,380
- 我们甩掉他们了吗 - 嘿 停下
- Did we lose them? - Hey, stop!

1604
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:20,610
- 你们没买票 - 抱歉
- You didn't pay! - Sorry.

1605
01:29:20,610 --> 01:29:23,470
没事 有我呢 他们只不过特喜欢潜艇
It's all right, I've got them! They just love submarines.

1606
01:29:25,910 --> 01:29:26,820
他们可有点粗鲁
They're a bit rude.

1607
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:29,170
没错 是啊 这就是新一代的年轻人
Yes, they are, aren't they? That's the modern generation.

1608
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:32,580
而且这个博物馆要永久关门了
And this museum is closed for eternity.

1609
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:34,860
所有人 都给我出去
All you boys and girls, off the sub now!

1610
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:37,640
赶紧出去 快 快 快
Off the sub now! Move, move, move!

1611
01:29:37,640 --> 01:29:40,190
快走 死肥仔快走 快给我挤出去
Go on, push! Move your fat ass! Push! Squeeze!

1612
01:29:40,190 --> 01:29:41,170
走 走 走
Go, go, go!

1613
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:43,470
这东西发动不起来
This thing isn't gonna run.

1614
01:29:43,870 --> 01:29:47,760
任务是在未经探索的深水之中
The mission's in deep, unexplored waters.

1615
01:29:48,530 --> 01:29:49,480
真是棒极了
It's wonderful!

1616
01:29:49,890 --> 01:29:52,770
这里有一股男人们挤在一起的汗味
And the sour-sweet musk of men in close quarters.

1617
01:29:52,770 --> 01:29:54,710
其实有点恶心 真心的
It's quite disgusting, really.

1618
01:29:55,090 --> 01:29:56,010
但是这个
But now this,

1619
01:29:56,460 --> 01:29:58,220
史上最伟大的计划
the greatest mission of them all,

1620
01:29:58,390 --> 01:30:00,810
这是我一辈子所渴求的任务
one that I have longed for my entire life...

1621
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:05,650
它能改变人类的历史 知道么
To help turn the tide of human history, you know?

1622
01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:09,850
现在呢
Now, alas,

1623
01:30:11,810 --> 01:30:13,140
我再也不能和你们一起了
I can no longer join you.

1624
01:30:14,690 --> 01:30:17,720
但是大人 您等这一刻已经等了71年了
But, my lord, you have been waiting for this moment for 71 years.

1625
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:20,940
我知道 但我恐怕不是当骑士的料
I know, I know, but I'm not knighthood material, I'm afraid.

1626
01:30:21,450 --> 01:30:22,270
而且
And...

1627
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,530
你们有你们的任务 我也有我的任务
You have your mission, and I have mine.

1628
01:30:24,530 --> 01:30:27,280
不不 你不可以把我们和那个
Oh, no, no. You are not leaving us in this tin can

1629
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:29,460
四脚神经病一起丢在这个铁罐子里 这可不行
with that four-foot mental psychopath. I don't think so.

1630
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:31,510
我更喜欢反社会分子这个称呼
I prefer the word "sociopath".

1631
01:30:31,780 --> 01:30:33,850
凯德先生 你一生所做的所有事
Mr. Cade, everything you've done in your life,

1632
01:30:33,850 --> 01:30:35,860
你的痛苦与折磨
your pain and your suffering,

1633
01:30:35,860 --> 01:30:38,320
丧妻之痛 被迫和女儿分开
the loss of your wife, separation from your daughter,

1634
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:39,820
再加经济情况窘迫
your financial difficulties,

1635
01:30:39,820 --> 01:30:43,660
这一路来风雨不断 只为了此刻
it's all just been a journey to this very moment.

1636
01:30:46,730 --> 01:30:47,740
你话真多
You talk a lot.

1637
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:50,560
我也这么觉得
Yeah, I suppose I do.

1638
01:30:52,940 --> 01:30:53,680
亲爱的
My dear,

1639
01:30:54,940 --> 01:30:57,120
你爸爸把联盟号交给你
your father left the Alliance to you,

1640
01:30:57,820 --> 01:30:58,720
并且只交给了你
for you alone.

1641
01:30:59,170 --> 01:31:00,840
她知道该怎么做
She knows the way to the staff.

1642
01:31:01,250 --> 01:31:02,480
祝你们好运
Good luck to both of you.

1643
01:31:04,370 --> 01:31:06,480
这肯定不是我今天干过的最奇怪的事
It won't be the strangest thing I've done today.

1644
01:31:10,430 --> 01:31:12,480
希望她还会开
Hope the old girl's still got it.

1645
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:20,290
好运
Good luck!

1646
01:31:25,490 --> 01:31:26,990
那不是我干的
Okay. I didn't do that.

1647
01:31:28,270 --> 01:31:29,390
下潜了 你说下潜了是什么意思
Jumped? What do you mean, jumped?

1648
01:31:29,390 --> 01:31:31,460
二战老式潜艇刚刚自己下潜了
The old World War II sub jumped its moorings.

1649
01:31:31,460 --> 01:31:32,610
那肯定是个变形金刚
They're in a Transformer.

1650
01:31:43,070 --> 01:31:44,660
- 我能看看嘛 - 不行 我在看呢
- Can I get a look? - No, I'm looking.

1651
01:31:44,660 --> 01:31:46,100
你能让开么
Will you move?

1652
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:48,200
伙计 别挡路 那是海水吗
God, get out of the way, man! Is that water?

1653
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:50,740
- 大侦探真厉害 - 很明显是海水
- No shit, Sherlock. - Obviously, it's water.

1654
01:31:50,740 --> 01:31:51,520
你知道怎么开吗
Do you know how to operate it?

1655
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:52,400
你知道怎么开的吧
You know how to operate it, right?

1656
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:54,730
他说你负责开
He says you're in charge of this now.

1657
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,960
- 快让我看看 - 别再碰我
- Let me see. Let me see. - Don't touch me again!

1658
01:31:57,270 --> 01:31:58,160
别惹我
Don't freak me out.

1659
01:31:58,160 --> 01:32:00,820
在外星飞船发生的事就留在那里吧
What happens in the alien ship stays in the alien ship.

1660
01:32:00,820 --> 01:32:02,780
我要干死你
I will eff you up!

1661
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:06,540
指挥部 我这里探测到潜艇上浮
Surface, I have positive surface contact.

1662
01:32:06,540 --> 01:32:07,940
代码5205
Track number 5205.

1663
01:32:07,940 --> 01:32:09,390
潜艇肯定是要开往远海
The sub must be heading for open water,

1664
01:32:09,390 --> 01:32:10,480
直奔我们的突击小组
directly towards our strike group.

1665
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:11,980
好的 我们必须阻止他们
Okay, we have to cut 'em off. Stop 'em.

1666
01:32:11,980 --> 01:32:13,330
用尽我们手头的一切资源
Use whatever assets we have.

1667

联系祖鲁舱
Contact the Zulu module.

1668
01:32:14,460 --> 01:32:16,300
让所有潜艇扼守要道
Have all our subs converge on that chokepoint.

1669
01:32:17,130 --> 01:32:18,690
掌舵手 全体从侧面包抄

信号方向150
Contact bearing 150.

1672
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:34,190
我们得把海豹突击队送到深潜船上 我们得追他们
We need to get SEAL teams in DSVs. We need to chase 'em.

1673
01:32:37,570 --> 01:32:39,370
控制台 这是一号 准备进港
Control. Ace One, going to the bay.

1674

一号 准备进港
Ace One, going to the bay.

1675
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:55,150
长老 那样正常吗
Cogman? Is that normal?

1676
01:32:55,150 --> 01:32:56,450
非常正常 女士
Perfectly normal, ma'am.

1677
01:32:56,450 --> 01:32:58,610
一艘攻击型核潜艇正在我们后面
A nuclear-class attack submarine is on our stern.

1678
01:32:58,610 --> 01:33:00,580
- 什么 - 快点 跟紧我 快
- What? - Quick, follow me. Quick.

1679
01:33:01,060 --> 01:33:02,440
这是你的潜艇 不是我的
It's your sub, not mine.

1680
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:05,940
我的潜艇 七个小时前 我还只是个大学教授
My sub? Seven hours ago, I was just a professor.

1681
01:33:10,020 --> 01:33:11,250
好了 解钩
All right, uncoupling.

1682
01:33:20,630 --> 01:33:23,410
好了 动起来 动起来 高速模式
All right, let's move. Let's move. Put it in high gear.

1683
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:28,850
深潜船2号跟紧我们
DSV-2, stay on our tail.

1684
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:32,650
声吶 外星信号 一千码 还在靠近
Conn, Sonar. Alien contact, 1,000 yards and closing.

1685
01:33:32,650 --> 01:33:34,300
潜艇上的警报可不是个好消息
An alarm on a sub is not a good thing.

1686
01:33:34,300 --> 01:33:35,570
他们为什么要我们到这里
Why did he send us up here?

1687
01:33:35,570 --> 01:33:37,210
他让我们冲在前面 我们就先死
He got us up front so we die first.

1688

让他们知道我们在这里

声纳 对方掉头
Conn, Sonar. It's coming back around.

抓紧了
Hold on!

声纳 对方要下潜了
Conn, Sonar. He's going deep!

1697
01:34:27,940 --> 01:34:29,100
我们现在暂时安全了
We're clear for now.

1698
01:34:29,270 --> 01:34:32,320
放手 你们俩有的是时间和地方
Hands off! There is a time and a place for everything.

1699
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:34,560
但现在不行
This is not the time nor the place.

1700
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:36,610
- 嘿 - 现在没空
- Hey! - Not now!

1701
01:34:36,750 --> 01:34:38,610
- 你去哪 - 离开这里

那个小变态把自己当成鱼雷发射出去了
That little sicko just shot himself out like a torpedo!

1703
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:47,260
我知道 我又不瞎
I know! I saw it!

1704
01:34:47,260 --> 01:34:48,570

Those are your peoples.

急事啊 你怎么不早说
It's urgent, is it? Why didn't you say so?

1709
01:35:06,790 --> 01:35:08,230
谢谢你 混蛋
Thank you. Dickhead.

1710
01:35:08,230 --> 01:35:10,200

抱歉
Oh, my... Sorry.

1713

我胳膊上总有这东西
I just got this thing that was on my arm

1714
01:35:25,710 --> 01:35:27,440
而且好像还在乱动
and it's, like, just moving all around.

1715
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:31,250
是啊 看起来 你要是

从胳膊滑到
Slipping from the arm to the...

1718

- 是啊 往下滑了 - 往你的裤子里滑了
- Yeah, it's coming down. - It's going down your pants there.

1719
01:35:38,610 --> 01:35:39,310
小心点
Careful.

1720
01:35:40,050 --> 01:35:42,290
那东西紧吗 还是裹在里面
And is it tight or gripping on?

1721
01:35:42,290 --> 01:35:43,940
不疼 但我不知道它是干啥的
It doesn't hurt, but I don't know what it does.

1722
01:35:43,940 --> 01:35:45,340
就像个没用的外星垃圾
It's like some worthless alien junk.

1723
01:35:45,340 --> 01:35:48,580
我认为它是… 我们会弄清它是干啥的
I think the purpose... I think the... We'll find out what the purpose is.

1724
01:35:48,580 --> 01:35:50,060
如果你想的话
If... If you want to.

1725
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:55,550
长老 这都是啥
Cogmanl What is... What is all this?

1726
01:35:55,620 --> 01:35:56,440

我觉得最后的晚餐还是很应景的
I thought a meal, a last meal, would be in order.

- Great. I'm starving. - No canoodling.

1729

等会 长老
Wait, Cogman?

1730

- 我奶奶一定会… - 我女儿一定会喜欢的

- She keeps saying I've got to move on. - Yeah, I was about to say. She would love it.

1733
01:36:13,740 --> 01:36:15,220
- 真的吗 - 是的 一直都是
- Really? - Yes, all the time!

1734
01:36:15,220 --> 01:36:17,520
- 她怎么说的 - "去约会 去找个男朋友"
- What does she say? -"Go on a date, get a boyfriend."

1735
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:18,580
这算约会吗
Is this a date?

1736
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:22,190
不 天啊 这不是约会 这只是…
No. God, it's not a date. No. It's just that...

1737
01:36:22,190 --> 01:36:23,180
挺浪漫的
It's romantic.

1738

总统在地堡里了吗
Is the President in his bunker?

1743
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:46,340
是的
He is.

1744

那个门是用来应急的
That door is used for extraordinary circumstances,

1750
01:37:03,390 --> 01:37:05,920
而现在的情形就很紧急
and these circumstances are quite extraordinary.

1751
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:07,830
我长话短说
I will keep this very simple.

1752
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:09,460
这个家伙
Nasty little fellow.

1753
01:37:09,540 --> 01:37:12,450
我要是让他出来 咱们都会死的很惨
I let him out, we all die terrible deaths.

1754
01:37:12,450 --> 01:37:13,770
你明白了吗
Do you understand?

01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:15,780
谢谢
Thank you.

1756
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:18,370

变形金刚在地球历史的守密者

1759
01:37:23,890 --> 01:37:25,820
- 维基家族团 - 维基家族团 没错
- Witwiccans? - Witwiccans, yes.

1760
01:37:27,870 --> 01:37:29,990
但它们都灭绝了
But they all died out.

1761
01:37:30,130 --> 01:37:33,310
并不是灭绝了 目前还没有
Not all of them. Not yet, anyway.

1762
01:37:33,430 --> 01:37:36,170
但我需要你调动你所有的资源
But I do need you to marshal all your resources...

1763
01:37:36,170 --> 01:37:37,470
- 等会 你才… - 你最好闭嘴

1768
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,800
所有资源 所有军事资源
all your resources, all your military assets.

1769
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:55,230
因为你也大概想到了
Because as you no doubt have surmised,

1770
01:37:55,230 --> 01:37:56,940
世界要毁灭了
the world is going to end,

1771
01:37:57,070 --> 01:37:59,400
而我知道何时何地会毁灭
and I know where. And when.

1772
01:38:06,390 --> 01:38:10,040
你们是自中世纪以来第一个见到这艘船的人
You are the first to see this ship since the Dark Ages.

1773
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:14,530
你的护身符是解开这艘船的钥匙
Your talisman is the key to unlocking this ship.

1774
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:31,050
声吶显示 大概还有800米
Sonar has about 800 meters.

1775
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:35,270
我觉得四点钟方向有敌人
I think I got a bogey at four o'clock.

1776
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:37,540
我渐渐能看清楚了
We're starting to see it through the murk.

1777
01:38:39,740 --> 01:38:40,900
下面有灯
There's lights down here.

1778
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:46,010
天啊 快看 是艘大外星飞船
Oh, my God. Look at that. It's a big alien ship.

1779
01:38:46,330 --> 01:38:49,300
总部 你们看到了吗 真大啊
Topside, are you catching this? It's massive.

1780
01:38:55,550 --> 01:38:56,680
飞船知道我们来了
The ship knows we're here.

1781

也许有人偷了法杖

而不是什么神秘主义 童话故事 还有什么妖魔鬼怪

来重构和重建它自己 对吧

如果我们的地核冷却了 就像现在这样

地球的磁场就会消失

2077
02:05:55,200 --> 02:05:57,630

Very mean-looking.

2084

那些家伙不过是胆小鬼罢了
They look like wusses to me.

真的"有一群勇士愿意牺牲一切"

拉这个 光拉就行 玩命拉就行了
Pull? Just pull it? You just pull it as hard as you can?

2103
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:12,160

我信仰的可是一个伟人

02:08:34,120 --> 02:08:36,030
你们不信他 全世界都不信他
You did. The whole world did.

2130
02:08:36,590 --> 02:08:37,930
现在你们又想和我一起了

伦诺克斯 你的队伍待命

战斗机在各个方向都损失惨重
Strike fighters are getting shot down.

2136
02:09:03,890 --> 02:09:07,250
不 必须要趁现在 飞行员 现在跳 走

- 你在这里干什么 - 我不知道

但是你说过我们是家人

2141
02:09:14,800 --> 02:09:17,640
不 我不是要你… 现在就得把她弄下去
No, I didn't mean... We got to get her off here now.

2142
02:09:18,520 --> 02:09:20,010
现在说不合适了吧
It was probably a bad idea.

2143
02:09:26,210 --> 02:09:27,740
六架飞机出动了
Six birds out of the nest.

2144
02:09:34,420 --> 02:09:35,260
所有鱼鹰就位
All Ospreys clear.

2145
02:09:35,260 --> 02:09:36,770
向目标推进 向目标推进
Push the target, push the target.

让敌人远离这些鱼鹰
Keep those enemies away from the Ospreys!

控制台 分散队形 分散队形
Control, spread it out, spread it out.

2152
02:10:14,270 --> 02:10:16,830
那些战斗机最好分散掉敌方兵力
Those fighters better distract those enemy ships!

2153
02:10:19,170 --> 02:10:20,960
前方敌机来袭 一点钟方向
I got bogeys coming in hot, one o'clock.

2154
02:10:26,210 --> 02:10:27,390
三架敌机 小心
I got three bogeys.

2155
02:10:30,570 --> 02:10:31,690

蝰蛇号 注意那个火力点
Viper Flight, focus on that gun.

2160

需要增援 需要增援
Back up. Hurry up, back up.

2169
02:11:55,090 --> 02:11:56,280
敌方战斗机
Enemy fighters!

2170
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:35,510
那个火力点实在太猛了
That gun emplacement is tearing us apart!

2171
02:12:39,530 --> 02:12:42,010
点火室在那儿 就在前面
There's the ignition chamber, dead ahead!

2172
02:12:46,910 --> 02:12:48,870
空中掩护过不来 来不了
Air cover not coming. Unable.

2173
02:12:53,050 --> 02:12:54,250
走起 大黄蜂
Let's ride, Bee!

和探长一起干他们
Pinned down with the Hound!

- 没辙了 擎天柱在哪儿呢 - 他们说他来不了了
- No way. Where's Optimus? - They said he never made it.

2178

We got the big gun on us!

2179

这么个烂摊子真是太让人不爽了
It's just a cluster effin' thingamabobl

听着 我需要你过去把那个火力点炸了
Look, I need you to blow that gun up!

2186
02:13:51,780 --> 02:13:52,680
不去
Mommy.

2187
02:13:52,680 --> 02:13:55,200
你个儿又小 长得又丑 没人会看到你过去的
You're small and you're ugly. No one's gonna see you coming.

2188
02:13:57,640 --> 02:13:58,680
快炸了它
Blow it up!

2189
02:14:04,940 --> 02:14:06,370
求雨鬼
Infernocus,

2190
02:14:06,710 --> 02:14:09,320
变形吧 干掉他们
transform. Kill them!

2191
02:14:14,950 --> 02:14:16,950
我的弹药不够对付那个家伙
I don't have enough ammo for that thing.

2192
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:17,920
我来搞定他
I got him!

2193
02:14:35,840 --> 02:14:38,080
大黄蜂和热破不行了 汽车人不行了
Bee and Hot Rod are down! Autobots down!

2194
02:14:38,150 --> 02:14:39,240
擎天柱在哪儿
Where's Prime?

2195
02:14:39,240 --> 02:14:40,410
唉 吉娃娃
Ay, chihuahua.

2196
02:14:40,410 --> 02:14:42,530
打不过去呀 将军 火力压制太猛了
It's a no-go, General. We're pinned down!

2197
02:14:42,650 --> 02:14:44,960
好吧 之前的办法都不起作用 对吧
Yeah, well, that hobgoblin stuff didn't work, did it?

2198
02:14:45,150 --> 02:14:47,160
我还有一招 物理手段怎么样
I got a Hail Mary. How about physics?

2199
02:14:47,450 --> 02:14:48,680
好吧 我刚刚做了模拟
Okay, I just did the simulation.

2200
02:14:48,680 --> 02:14:50,860
它就像是泰格·伍兹用九号球杆铲起了
It's like if Tiger Woods was making a big divot

2201
02:14:50,860 --> 02:14:51,700
一大块草皮
with his nine-iron.

2202
02:14:51,700 --> 02:14:53,290
史杜 别挡着 拜托
Stu, out! Come on, man.

2203
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:55,780
好了 这儿有好大一块都是被那些藤条给拉住的
All right, there's a chunk right here that's held up by thin vines.

2204
02:14:55,780 --> 02:14:57,930
你必须炸断藤条 使用战术核武器炸断藤条
You gotta blow up those vines, use tactical nukes to blow out

2205
02:14:57,930 --> 02:14:59,040
好让它摆动起来
the vines and let it swing.

2206
02:14:59,040 --> 02:15:00,240
然后地心引力起作用
Okay, you let gravity do the rest.

2207
02:15:00,240 --> 02:15:01,320
点火室接着就停了
The chamber comes down,

2208
02:15:01,320 --> 02:15:03,580
能量传输停止了 地球就能保住了
the energy transfer stops, and the Earth is saved.

2209
02:15:03,580 --> 02:15:04,510
不用谢
You're welcome.

2210
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:06,740
给我接战术核武部门
I need tac-nuke authority.

2211
02:15:06,740 --> 02:15:09,350
伦诺克斯 带着你的人撤离 任务结束了
Lennox team, we are pulling you out. Mission's over.

2212
02:15:09,350 --> 02:15:11,210
给即将抵达的战机指明目标
Laze targets for incoming strike fighters.

2213
02:15:11,210 --> 02:15:12,600
然后听我的撤退指令
Then I'm ordering you to bail.

2214
02:15:12,600 --> 02:15:13,890
收到 有图像了
Roger that. Picture's up.

2215
02:15:14,320 --> 02:15:15,620
我看见了 我看见了
I see it, I see it.

2216
02:15:16,430 --> 02:15:19,570
我们有新目标了 往上三点钟方向
We got a new target! Three o'clock high!

2217
02:15:19,920 --> 02:15:22,320
激光标记新目标给过来的飞机看
Laze the new target for incoming birds.

2218
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:23,880
他们要把整个玩意儿都夷平了
They're gonna bring that whole thing down on us.

2219
02:15:23,880 --> 02:15:25,790
听着 我们不能放弃擎天柱 好吗
Hey! We're not giving up on Prime, okay?

2220
02:15:25,790 --> 02:15:26,590
他会来的
He's gonna be here!

2221
02:15:26,590 --> 02:15:28,920
他们刚刚改了整个计划 我们进不去
They just changed the whole plan. We can't get inside.

2222
02:15:28,920 --> 02:15:31,040
- 什么 - 我们的行动结束了
- What? - The operation is over.

2223
02:15:31,220 --> 02:15:32,610
我们再待着 就死定了
We stay, we're dead.

2224
02:15:32,610 --> 02:15:33,560
我必须进那儿去
I have to get in there!

2225
02:15:33,560 --> 02:15:35,430
所有人拿好降落伞 我们要撤了
Everybody, grab your chutes, we're bailing!

2226
02:15:39,360 --> 02:15:40,360
你

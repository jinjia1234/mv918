00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,480
先别开火 金库里还有个女人
Hold your fire. There's a woman with him in the vault.

159
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:05,530
长官 恐怕 那是你老婆
Sir, I believe... that's your wife.

160
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,290
弗朗西斯
Francis?

161
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,750
想起来了
Oh, I've got it!

162
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,800
想起来了 我要抢银行
I've got it. I'm robbing the bank!

163
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,500
朝他开枪
Shoot him!

164
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,340
这可不在计划之中
That was not part of the plan.

165
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,810
拦下他 别让他跑了
Stop him! Don't let him get away!

166
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,530
从没有女人会用我的望远镜
No woman has ever handled my Herschel

167
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,340
开路
Clear the path.

168
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,130
不 不要啊
No, no, no, no!

169
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,300
停下 快停下
Stop, stop... stop!

170
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,900
右急转
Hard to starboard!

171
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,880
先生 你的天轴歪了
Sir, your celestial fix was off.

172
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,420
我为你向北调整了两度 你的地图不会再不准确了
I have adjusted two degrees north. Your map will no longer be imprecise.

173
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,680
不过你得重新画了
Although you will have to start again with it.

174
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,760
你是女巫
You're a witch.

175
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,680
我不是 因为记录了两百多颗星星
No, I'm not. Am I a witch for having cataloged.

176
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,220
- 我就成了女巫吗 - 女巫
- Over 200 stars? - Witch!

177
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,930
血月要来临了
There is a blood moon coming.

178
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,940
我只是想来买东西
I simply need to purchase.

179
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:26,940
精密记时表
A chronometer.

180
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,820
我愿意出双倍价钱让你卖给我这个女人
I pay you double for selling to a woman.

181
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,980
来人啊
Help me!

182
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:37,160
快来人 我店里有个女巫
Help! Help! There is a witch in my shop.

183
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:40,490
还有个海盗
And a pirate!

184
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,750
我店里有个海盗和女巫
There is a witch and a pirate in my shop.

185
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,290
那你今天可真幸运
Well this is your lucky day!

186
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,540
你们有谁看到我的银行了吗
Have either of the four of you seen my bank?

187
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,090
找到了
Found it.

188
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,680
- 原计划里有你吗 - 我不想惹麻烦
- Were you part of the plan? - I am not looking for trouble.

189
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,510
你活着真没意思
What a horrible way to live.

190
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:11,480
- 别让那女巫跑了 抓住她 - 我们被困住了
- Stop that Witch! Get her! - We're trapped.

191
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,820
该怎么办
What do we do?

192
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,660
你得尖叫一下
You need to scream.

193
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:22,330
在那 抓住那女人
Over there! Secure that woman!

194
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:27,790
- 你个卑鄙的海盗 - 没必要指名道谢
- You filthy pirate! - No need for lame calling!

195
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,710
杰克
Jack!

196
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:12,420
桥
Bridge?

197
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,120
是空的
It's empty!

198
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,460
钱去哪了
Where is the dash?

199
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,580
你们觉得抢银行很容易吗
Do you think that robbing a bank is easy?

200
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,340
现在一个子儿都没抢到
You gaggle of gutless use of the wound...

201
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:58,170
还不是被你们这群饭桶害的
Guilty of putting me on this dreadful pickle in the first place.

202
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,260
都排好队 按老规矩上交保护费
Now line up... And offer me a tribute.

203
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,890
你还要我们给你钱
Do you want us to pay you?

204
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,970
我是不是这艘船的船长
Am I not the captain of this ship?

205
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,180
你把这叫船
You call this a ship?

206
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,860
- 说好的财宝呢 - 我们全都快饿死了
- Where is the treasure? - All of us are starving.

207
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,240
我们不会再跟着一个连船都没有的船长
We'll no longer follow a captain without a ship.

208
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,570
我有一艘船
I have a ship.

209
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,110
黑珍珠号从未离开我身边
Black Pearl has never left me side.

210
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:24,200
现在海盗巴巴罗萨才是海上的霸主
The pirate Barbarossa rules these seas now.

211
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,200
他有10艘船 全副武装
Has 10 ships. Guns full.

212
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,040
更别提他的炮弹了 听说每颗炮弹有18磅重
Not to mention his canon balls. Eighteen pounds each they say.

213
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,210
瘸子的球有那么重
One legged man with 18 pound balls?

214
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,340
难怪他走起路来那么好笑
That's why he walks funny.

215
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,340
好了 伙计们
Oh come, come mates?

216
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,630
我们不是一起找到了马其顿的宝藏吗
Did we not find the treasure of Macedonia together?

217
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,390
那就是堆烂木头
It was a troll of rotten wood.

218
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,970
- 迈达斯国王的金子 - 那是堆驴粪
- Gold of King Midas. - A pile of donkey dung.

219
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,810
认命吧 杰克 你就是个倒霉鬼
Face it Jack. Bad luck dogs you,

220
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:47,770
流年不利
day & night.

221
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:50,480
这都是些无稽之谈
Now that is a bliss of fabrication.

222
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,230
- 你丢了你的好运 - 你也丢了你的船
- You've lost your luck. - You've lost your ship.

223
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,030
现在 你还丢了你的船员
Now... you've lost your crew.

224
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:04,360
杰克·斯派洛已经不是我们的船长了
Jack Sparrow is no longer our captain.

225
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,910
对不起杰克 跟着你实在混不下去了
I'm sorry Jack. But we've reached the end of the horizon.

226
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,850
你们全被解雇了
You're all dismissed.

227
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,060
全部 解雇了
All of ya! Dismissed!

228
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,270
以后别想再和杰克·斯派洛船长一起出海了
Never sail with Captain Jack Sparrow again.

229
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,520
知道吗
Tell you that.

230
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,820
全镇的人都在讨论你
The whole town speaks of you.

231
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,240
君王号上唯一的幸存者
The only survivor of the Monarch. A boy who pelled...

232
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,200
一个靠着块木头 逆流而上
All the way to St Martin, against the tide.

233
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,830
一路划到了圣马丁的男孩
On a piece of wood.

234
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,000
嘴里口齿不清得念叨海盗
Now gibbering about pirates.

235
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,040
和三叉戟
And tridents.

236
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,170
拜托长官 帮我拿掉镣铐吧
Please sir, let me go off these chains.

237
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:42,460
我的职责是保护这个岛以及这片海域
My job is to protect this island and these waters.

238
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:48,390
而你的袖子被撕掉了 这是叛徒的标志
And your sleeves have been ripped, The mark of treason.

239
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:49,310
我们被死人袭击了
We were attacked by the dead.

240
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:51,430
那你就是临阵逃脱了
You're a coward who ran from battle.

241
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,100
按逃兵处死
That is how you die.

242
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:09,740
- 我不相信你是个逃兵 - 请让我一个人静静
- I don't believe you're a coward. - Please leave me sister.

243
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,410
我冒着生命危险到这来
I've risked my life to come here.

244
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,540
来瞧瞧传言是不是真的
To see if the rumors are true.

245
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:17,290
- 你是在说三叉戟吗 - 你是谁
- Are you speak of the Trident? - Who are you?

246
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:22,420
- 告诉我你为什么要找三叉戟 - 三叉戟可以
- Tell me why you seek the trident? - The Trident can break,

247
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,960
破除海上的任何诅咒
any curse at sea.

248
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:27,340
我父亲就陷入了类似的诅咒
My father is trapped by such a curse.

249
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,550
你知道诅咒这种事并没有科学依据
You're aware that curses are not supported by science.

250
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,800
- 科学也不承认鬼魂存在 - 看来你真的疯了
- Neither the ghosts. - So you have gone mad?

251
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:35,430
- 我就不该到这来 - 那你为什么要来这
- I should never have come here. - Then why did you come here?

252
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:37,680
因为我要离开这岛
Because I need to get off this island.

253
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:38,890
解读无人能懂的海图
To solve the map.

254
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,150
无人能懂的海图
"No man can read".

255
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,310
波塞冬留下的海图
Left by Poseidon himself.

256
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:48,110
- 你知道那个传说 - 我看过所有的译本
- You've read the ancient text? - In each language they were written.

257
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,370
但没人见过那海图
But this map has never been seen or read,

258
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,620
没人看得懂
by any man.

259
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:55,950
幸好我是个女人
Luckily I am a woman.

260
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:02,420
这是伽利略·伽利莱的日记
This is the diary of Galileo Galilei.

261
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:05,050
他用尽一生在寻找三叉戟
He's spent his life searching for the Trident,

262
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,430
他为了找三叉戟发明了望远镜
It's why he invented the spyglass.

263
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:10,510
所以天文学家才总是盯着天空看
Why astronomers' spend their lives staring in to the sky.

264
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,720
你是说没人能读懂的海图
So you're saying the map no man can read,

265
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,430
就藏在星空里
Is hidden in the stars?

266
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:18,810
这是我父亲留给我的 他相信我能找到
It was left to me by my father. He believe I could find...

267
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:21,020
别人找不到的东西
What no man has ever found.

268
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,560
我不会让他失望的
I will not let him down.

269
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,780
很快就会出现血月
Soon, there will be blood moon.

270
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,860
只有那时我才能解读海图
Only then can the map be read.

271
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,780
- 才能找到三叉戟 - 你是谁
- And the Trident found. - Who are you?

272
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:35,080
- 卡丽娜·史密斯 - 如果你想救你父亲
- Carina Smyth! - If you have to save your father,

273
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,870
你就得先救我 找艘船
you'll have to save me. Find us a ship.

274
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,330
我们会找到三叉戟的
And the Trident will be ours.

275
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,420
给我回来 女巫
Come to me Witch!

276
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,050
他跑了
He's gone!

277
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,350
他跑了 长官
He's gone sir.

278
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,690
找到那个逃兵
Find that coward!

279
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:05,150
把他和那女巫一起吊死
He will hang with the witch.

280
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,730
觉得杰克船长老了不中用了
Think Capt. Jack washed up right?

281
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:13,240
我有好几年没洗澡了
I have not had a wash in years.

282
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:18,870
搜查那条巷子
Check the alley down there.

283
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,000
你们两个去搜教堂 剩下的跟我来
You two, check the church. Rest of you, with me.

284
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:30,260
糟了
Bugger!

285
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:54,110
- 能赏口酒喝吗 - 先把钱拿出来
- May I please have a drink, please? - Show me your silver.

286
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,200
要钱
Silver?

287
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,830
做个交易怎样
How about a trade?

288
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,000
给我一瓶酒
Give me the bottle.

289
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,470
船长
Capitan.

290
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,810
怎么了
What's happening?

291
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:15,110
杰克·斯派洛 杰克·斯派洛刚刚把他的罗盘送人了
Jack Sparrow, Jack Sparrow has given away the compass.

292
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,790
阳光
Daylight!

293
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,140
我们自由了
We're free!

294
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:59,820
好极 好极 是时候去狩猎那个海盗了
Now, now, it's time, to hunt a pirate.

295
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,040
海盗的人生啊
Pirate's life.

296
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,050
来吧 宝贝
Come to Daddy.

297
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,180
那家伙就是我们要找的人
Just the man we've been looking for.

298
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,220
为什么 找我干嘛
Why? Why am I looked for?

299
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,770
全城公告 杰克·斯派洛
Let it be known that the pirate Jack Sparrow...

300
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,980
将在天亮被处决
Will be executed at dawn.

301
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,270
处决
Executed?

302
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:36,190
我不会再来这镇子了 长官 我说到做到
I will never set foot in this town again, sir. Be mark of words.

303
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:25,010
释放海洋的力量
To release the power of the sea.

304
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,180
即可分离一切
One must divide.

305
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:34,680
是个岛 星星指引向一座岛
It's an island. The stars lead to an island.

306
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:55,210
- 我在找一个海盗 杰克·斯派洛 - 滚开
- I'm looking for a pirate, Jack Sparrow. - Bugger off!

307
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,670
我跟你打听个人
I need to speak with you.

308
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,640
- 把你的剑给我 - 我没有剑
- Give me your sword. - I don't have a sword.

309
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,350
- 什么样的士兵没有武器 - 我因为叛国被通缉
- What kind of soldier has no weapon? - I'm counting on to the treason.

310
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,100
看来你也不是个好兵
So, not a very good kind.

311
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,850
我在找杰克·斯派洛船长
I am looking for a pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow?

312
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:24,360
今天是你的幸运日 因为正巧我就是
Today is your lucky day. Because I just happen to be...

313
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:27,780
船长 杰克·斯派洛
Captain Jack Sparrow.

314
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,240
不 不会吧
No, it can't be.

315
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:37,540
我找了那么多年的人 竟是这样
I've spent years searching for... this?

316
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:40,460
伟大的杰克·斯派洛怎么会是个坐牢的酒鬼
The great Jack Sparrow is not some drunk in a cell.

317
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,380
你的船呢 船员呢
Do you even have a ship? A crew?

318
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:46,260
裤子呢
Pants.

319
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:49,800
伟大的海盗不拘小节
A great pirate does not require such intricacies.

320
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,930
你知道我等这一刻等了多久吗
Do you know how long I've been waiting for this moment?

321
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:54,100
我冒了多少险才到了这
The risks I've taken to be here?

322
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:57,520
- 你确定你就是杰克·斯派洛 - 最该问的是
- Are you sure you're the Jack Sparrow? - The real question is...

323
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:00,150
- 你是谁 - 我叫亨利·特纳
- Who are you? - My name is Henry Turner.

324
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,480
威尔·特纳和伊丽莎白·斯旺的儿子
Son of Will Turner and Elisabeth Swann.

325
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,400
你是他俩生的坏小子
You are the evil spawn of them two?

326
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:08,870
你妈有和你提到过我吗
Does mommy ever ask about me?

327
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:09,570
没有
No.

328
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:13,080
说说嘛 她梦里一直呼唤我的名字吧
Go on. She calls my name in the sleep?

329
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,620
她从没提起过你
She never spoke of you.

330
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,790
你确定我们说的是同一个人？
Are you sure we're talking about the same people?

331
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,800
男是个被诅咒的太监
He is a cursed eunuch.

332
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,460
女的有一头金发 很固执
She has golden hair, stubborn,

333
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:25,630
撅着嘴 脖子像长颈鹿一样
pouty lips. Neck like a giraffe.

334
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:28,630
- 还有一对傲人的 - 是 是 就是她
- And two of the those wonderful. - Yes Yes, it's her!

335
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:31,890
听着 杰克
I need you to listen Jack.

336
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,850
我现在只能指望你了
Because at the moment you're all I have got.

337
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,680
我找到了救我父亲的方法 有一件神器能打破诅咒
I found the way to save my father. There is one thing that can break his curse.

338
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:39,480
让他离开荷兰人号
And free him from the Dutchmen.

339
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:43,440
波塞冬的三叉戟
The Trident of Poseidon.

340
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,740
要找这件宝物
The treasure that can be found with...

341
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:50,070
就得靠一张没人看得懂的海图
the map that no man can read.

342
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:54,410
从没听说过
Never heard of it.

343
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,290
杰克 这里关着个女孩
There's a girl inside this prison Jack,

344
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:58,450
她有那张海图
who holds that map.

345
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:01,540
血月已经开始了 三叉戟就要现世
The moon has turned to blood, the trident will be found.

346
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,550
你将成为掌控大海的人
And you could be the one who holds the sea.

347
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,630
有了它你就能重振雄风
And with it become all that you once were.

348
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:06,710
伟大的
The great.

349
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,590
杰克
Jack!

350
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:12,840
对不起 你还在说吗
Oh, I'm so sorry. Were you still talking?

351
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,760
还有件事
One more thing.

352
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:20,180
一个你认识的人留了一条消息 他叫萨拉查船长
A message from someone you know, named Captain Salazar.

353
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:25,480
我曾经认识一个西班牙人叫这个名字
I once knew a Spaniard named.

354
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,940
是西班牙语
Something in Spanish.

355
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,490
海上屠夫
El Matador Del Mar. The butcher of the sea.

356
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:35,450
他 不不不 他死了 这点我很开心
Him? No, no, no. Quite happily he's dead.

357
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:37,950
死的很透很透 他的船沉了
Very, very dead. Ship went down...

358
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,330
沉在了魔鬼三角洲里
Inside the triangle.

359
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:42,210
他来找你了 杰克 来报仇了
He's coming for you Jack, to seek revenge.

360
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:43,830
死人的传说就是这样讲的
As the dead man's tale is told...

361
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,500
我不相信你
I don't believe you.

362
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,260
他怎么说
What did he say?

363
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,880
他说你的罗盘是
He said your compass was the key

364
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,890
他逃脱的关键 一支死人的大军
to his escape. An army of dead,

365
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,590
直接朝着你来了 杰克
are coming straight for you, Jack.

366
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,260
海神三叉戟是你的唯一的希望
The Trident of Poseidon is your only hope.

367
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,770
我们说定了吗
Do we have an accord?

368
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,740
- 我才不要去那里告诉他 - 是你的主意
- I am not going in there to tell him. - It was your idea!

369
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,830
不 我的主意是让你去告诉他
No, it was my idea for you to tell him.

370
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,580
他更喜欢你
He likes you more than me.

371
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,410
他不喜欢任何人
He doesn't like anybody.

372
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:45,230
抱歉 先生 我们知道您说过永远不要打扰您
Sorry sir. We know you said never to disturb you.

373
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:47,230
或者没有好的理由就跑过来
Or to come in without good cause.

374
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:49,150
或者开口说话前没有先
Or to speak without first.

375
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,400
请教您我们的想法
To ask you now whether our,

376
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,990
是不是绝对必要
thoughts were absolutely necessary.

377
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:57,200
好比那一次我们的船着火了
Like the time the ship was on fire.

378
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,290
那是一个必要的想法的例子
That being an example of necessary thought.

379
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:02,580
所以 我们再次为引发那场火道歉
So again, we do apologize for starting that fire.

380
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,500
讲
Speak!

381
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,590
是我们的船 先生 它们正在遭受敌人的攻击
It's the ships, sir. They are being attacked by an enemy...

382
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:18,260
- 敌人抢走了财宝 - 他们随随便便就会杀人
- That takes the Riches. - Kills without provocation.

383
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:21,140
我的船 不可能
My ships? Not possible!

384
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,350
其中的三艘已经沉了 先生
Three of them already been sunk, Sir.

385
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,270
下手的是一个叫萨拉曼达的船长
They have been sunk by a captain called Salamander!

386
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,810
萨拉查
Salazar.

387
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,560
萨拉查
Salazar!

388
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:34,280
就是他 先生大人 他在每一艘船上留下一个活口
That's him, your sireness! He leaves one man from each vessel...

389
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:38,610
来讲他的故事 整个舰队都在沉没
To tell the tale. The entire fleet is being sunk.

390
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:41,660
我们马上就要死了
And we'll soon be dead.

391
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:45,040
而且很有可能关门大吉
And quite possibly out of business.

392
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:53,710
我需要和你们的女巫待一段时间
I'll be needing some time with your witch...

393
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:13,730
我一直在等你 船长 你要喝杯茶吗
I have been expecting you Captain. Perhaps you would like some tea.

394
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,740
不用了 非常感谢
I shall pass, thank you kindly.

395
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:24,410
进我的门的代价是鲜血 船长
The price of crossing my door is blood, Captain.

396
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:28,000
这就解释了为什么你生意这么冷清
That explains why you're not so busy.

397
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:31,000
每个人最终都会付出代价的
Everyone pays, eventually.

398
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:35,090
沙萨 你我很久以前就有交情了
Shansa, you and I made a bond long ago.

399
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,880
我把你从绞刑架上救了下来
I saved you from the gallows.

400
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:37,800
记得吗
Remember?

401
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,220
而我也诅咒了你的敌人
And I cursed your enemies.

402
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,810
现在你心怀恐惧来找我
But now you come to me with fear.

403
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:46,100
在死人统治了大海的时候
As the dead have taken command over the sea.

404
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:49,400
死人找我做什么
And what would the dead be wanting with me?

405
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,600
不是你 船长
Not you, Captain.

406
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:55,650
- 他们在找斯派洛 - 杰克？
- They're searching for a Sparrow. - Jack?

407
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:04,700
杰克会乘船去找三叉戟 带着一个女孩和一颗珍珠
Jack who sails for the trident... With a girl and a Pearl.

408
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:08,370
三叉戟永远不能被找到
The trident can never be found.

409
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,500
三叉戟是杰克唯一的希望
The trident is Jack's only hope.

410
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:16,420
死者统治了大海
The dead are conquering the sea,

411
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,920
却无法登上陆地
unable to step on dry land.

412
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,840
也许你该退休 回到乡下生活了
Maybe you should retire to the country side.

413
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,810
你说回到草地吗
You mean grass?

414
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,020
在农场里
On a farm?

415
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:34,350
给牛挤奶 制作奶酪
Milking a cow, making cheese.

416
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:40,150
- 看着他们把我的财宝都沉掉 - 船长 请你自己想想
- While they sink mi treasure? - Ask yourself this, Captain.

417
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:44,910
- 这些财宝值得你去死吗 - 我是一个海盗
- Is this treasure worth dying for? - I'm a pirate.

418
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:48,830
永远都是 所以我该怎么保护
Always will be! So how do I save,

419
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:51,630
- 属于我的东西 - 杰克有一个罗盘
- what be mine. - Jack held a compass.

420
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:54,460
会指给你你最渴望的东西
Which points you to the thing you desire most.

421
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,630
但是你如果背叛罗盘
But betray the compass...

422
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,260
它就会释放你最大的恐惧
And it releases your greatest fear.

423
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:02,920
而一个海盗最大的恐惧是萨拉查 是吧
And a pirate's greatest fear will be Salazar, is it?

424
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:09,600
- 你怎么拿到这个的 - 我自有办法
- How did you get this? - I have my ways.

425
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:12,770
把他们带向杰克 在他找到三叉戟之前
Lead them to Jack before he finds the trident.

426
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:16,650
这样你的财宝都会回到你的手中
And all your treasure will come back to you.

427
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:20,690
是时候和死者做一笔交易了
Time to make a deal with the dead.

428
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:25,700
快点 海盗
Come on, pirate.

429
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,080
等一下 停
Hold on, stop.

430
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:43,130
- 杰克叔叔 - 小杰 你怎么样
- Uncle Jack! - Jackie boy, how is it going?

431
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:44,970
没什么可抱怨的 你呢
Can't complain really. You?

432
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:47,430
我在这里等了一上午了 等着被打一顿
I've been waiting all morning in here, for a beating.

433
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:50,430
- 但是这里的服务太差了 - 太不像话了
- But the service is terrible. - Shameful.

434
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:51,970
杰克
Jack.

435
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:56,110
海洋将被鲜血染红
The oceans have turned to blood.

436
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:59,110
你最好待在陆地上 那里比较安全
Best to stay on dry land, where it's safe.

437
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:02,780
我就要在陆地上被处死了
I'm about to be executed on dry land.

438
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:03,780
有道理
Good point.

439
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:06,030
我给你讲过骷髅的故事吗
Did I ever told you about the skeleton?

440
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,410
你讲过 讲过好多次了
Yes you have, many times.

441
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:10,200
骷髅走进一个酒馆 点了一杯酒
Skeleton goes into a bar, orders a beer.

442
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:11,620
还要了一个拖把
And a mop.

443
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:15,000
一如既往地好笑
Funny as ever.

444
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,620
好了 走吧
Come on let's go!

445
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:23,050
如果他们要开你的膛 记得找维克托 他手法最好
If they disembowel you, ask for Viktor. He's got the softest hands.

446
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,050
谢了！
Thank you!

447
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:26,930
提我的名字 他们就不会砍掉你的脚
And mention my name, they won't cut your feet off.

448
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,820
来吧 你是第一个
Come on. You're first!

449
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:55,080
海盗 你想怎么死
And how would you like to die pirate?

450
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:59,080
绞死 枪决 还有一个新的发明
Hanging, firing squad or a new invention.

451
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:01,420
- 断头台 - 断头台
- The guillotine. - Guillotine?

452
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,970
听起来像法国的东西 我喜欢法国的东西
Sounds french. I love the French.

453
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:06,050
你知道他们发明了蛋黄酱吗
Did you know they've invented mayonnaise?

454
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:08,430
能有多差劲 是法国的 对吧
How bad could it be? It's French, right?

455
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:14,640
哦 我的锅 我改变主意啦
Oh, my bad! I change mi mind...

456
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:23,980
请可怜可怜我 我睡觉都尿床的
No please have mercy for me. I am a bed wetter.

457
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:42,340
不是吧
Oh, come on!

458
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,970
我为这事还要爬楼梯吗
I mean I have to walk upstairs as well for this?

459
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:48,590
- 把篮子拿过来 - 篮子 干什么用的
- Bring the basket. - Basket... why?

460
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,380
把他摁倒
Step him down!

461
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:01,690
我有个主意
Here's an idea.

462
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:05,980
要不我们试试传统的石刑吧 我现在很希望被石刑处死
Why don't we try good old fashioned stoning? I'd kill to be stoned right now.

463
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:08,030
能让人群都参与进来 不是吗
Gets the crowd involved, doesn't it?

464
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,240
我希望就开膛一事同维克托谈谈
I should like to speak to Victor in disembowelment.

465
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,530
我希望同维克谈谈
I should like to speak to Vic.

466
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,200
我一般很少抱怨
I'm not the one who, complain normally,

467
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:17,410
但是这个篮子里都是脑袋
but this basket is full of heads.

468
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,380
卡丽娜·史密斯的遗言 安静
Final words of Carina Smyth. quiet!

469
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:37,010
卡丽娜·史密斯的遗言
The final words of Carina Smyth.

470
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:39,770
她说 我不是个女巫
It says. I'm not a witch.

471
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:43,230
但是我原谅了你们这常见的愚蠢的无知和低能的大脑
But I forgive your common dim witlessness and feeble brains.

472
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,440
简单来说 你们大部分人都有个羊脑子
In short, most of you have the mind of a goat.

473
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,610
请原谅 长官 对于那些将要被处死之人
Pardon me sir. It's not common practice...

474
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:49,450
这不是常见的做法吧
for those about to be executed.

475
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:52,120
让他们留下遗言 或者说 类似的
To be granted a last, I don't know, some of a...?

476
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,950
我正在说话 麻烦你耐心一点
I believe I was making a point. If you could just be patient.

477
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,370
不
No.

478
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:59,410
我脑袋就要被砍掉了 我这里很急
My head's about to be lopped off. Hence the urgency.

479
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:00,920
我脖子还要断掉了呢
And my neck is to be broken.

480
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,670
你是否知道在个别情况下 脖子并不真的会断掉
Did you know that on occasion, the neck doesn't actually break.

481
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:05,630
- 只是会很疼 - 什么
- It just hurts. - What?

482
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:06,710
是的
Oh Yes.

483
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,550
我见过有的人挂了好几个小时
I have seen men swing for hours.

484
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:10,130
眼珠凸出 舌头膨胀
Eyes bulging, tongues swelling.

485
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:12,220
- 发出恶心的咯咯声 - 能让我说完吗
- Revolting gurgling sound. - May I finish?

486
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,840
不能 你太幸运了
No. You're lucky.

487
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:15,390
我还想被绞死呢
Wish I was hung.

488
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,850
- 先杀了这个破海盗 我等着 - 女巫优先！
- Kill the filthy pirate, I'll wait... - The witch is first!

489
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:20,850
我不是女巫 你有没有在听啊
I'm not a witch. Did not you listen?

490
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:23,020
有个羊脑子很难认真听的
Quite hard to listen when you have the mind of a goat.

491
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,810
够了 两个人都杀了
Enough! Kill them both.

492
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:26,310
好
Yes!

493
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:50,500
想多了吧 你以为你能打败我们
Guess another news. Did you think you could defeat us boy?

494
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:53,090
不 先生 我只是转移注意力的
No sir, I'm just a diversion.

495
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,510
开火
Fire!

496
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:23,080
我还是想被石刑
I still rather be stoned.

497
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:29,710
装弹
Reload!

498
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,650
谢了
Thank you.

499
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:02,950
过来 你个海盗渣滓
Come here. You Pirate Scum!

500
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:04,040

接住你了
Got you!

505
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:58,090
你来接谁来了 叛徒
Who you'd come tolling back traitor?

506
00:47:58,170 --> 00:47:59,470
那个叫特纳的小伙子给了我们
The Turner boy gave us...

507
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:01,930
十个银币来救你
Ten pieces of silver to save your neck.

508
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:10,650
从这一刻起我们是盟友了
From this moment on we're to be allies.

509
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:12,150
考虑到你左手的位置

510
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:14,400
- 我看我们可不只是盟友 - 我们一起去找三叉戟
- I'd say we're more than that. - We'd find the Trident together.

511
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,280
你能向我承诺吗
Do I have your word?

512
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,190
除了承诺我什么都要给你了
You're holding everything but my word.

513
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,740
那我把拯救我的荣誉赠予你
Then I bestow upon you the honor of saving me.

514
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:20,950

515
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:23,490
你指望我们付钱给你来救你
You expect us to pay you to save you?

516
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:25,950
是的
Yes!

517
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,290
就收十个银币
For a mere 10 pieces.

518
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:36,710
疯了
Madness!

519
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:39,420
- 我们不会付超过五个 - 那行吧
- We won't pay more than 5. - Well, then.

520
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:40,840
八个就八个吧
Eight it is.

521
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:42,390
我们能不能晚点再讨论这个
Perhaps we could discuss this later.

522
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:44,260
我现在快撑不住你的左舷了
As I am having trouble here hoisting your port

523
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:47,470
- 这根本不是左舷 是我的船尾 - 你确定吗
- You are far from port, That is my stern. - Are you sure?

524
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,430
- 确定 - 好么 看啊
- Positive. - Well, look at this.

525
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:53,940
如果我杀了那个懦夫 女巫会吊死
If I kill the coward. The witch hangs.

526
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:56,900
- 一箭双雕 - 拜托不要放开我
- Two for the price of one. - Please don't let go of me.

527
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:58,780
他杀掉我之后可能就很难保证这一点了
It might be difficult once he kills me.

528
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,660
先生们 这两位囚犯将带领我们
Gentlemen, these two prisoners will lead us,

529
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:09,160
去找三叉戟

530
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:15,210
船长 你真觉得我们能找得到三叉戟吗
Captain. Do you really think we can find the trident?

531
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:16,630
吉布斯船长 你这是自寻烦恼
Master Gibbs, you're worrywart.

532
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:19,210
又没有什么好担心的
There is nothing to be concerned about.

533
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:25,970
- 能出什么岔子呢 - 这就是你的计划吗
- What could possibly go wrong, right? - So this was your plan?

534
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:27,550
被海盗们折磨杀害
To be tortured and killed by pirates?

535
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:28,850
你说你需要一艘船的
You said you needed a ship.

536
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:31,350
- 你管这叫船 - 切断缆索

537
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,940
准备出发
Prepare to drown.

538
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:00,550

正前方发现一只船
Ship dead ahead.

543
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:49,300
长官
Sir.

544
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:54,640
我们绝不会质疑您的决断
We would never question your reason as a captain.

545
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:55,890
但是
But, however...

546
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:59,400
您选择朝这个令人费解的方向
Is there a reason as captain, you've chosen...

547
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,310
航行有什么原因吗
To sail in this unreasonable direction?

548
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:04,320
告诉所有人准备迎战
Tell the men to prepare to be boarded.

549
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,450
坚守阵地
To stand their ground.

550
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:07,200
不要面带惧色
And show no fear.

551
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:16,450
船长 有一艘船向我们这边驶来了
Capitan! A ship sails towards us.

552
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:46,190
萨拉查船长 我听说你在寻找杰克·斯派洛
Captain Salazar. I hear you've been looking for Jack Sparrow.

553
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,590
原地别动

554
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:16,060
等候指令
And await orders.

555
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:40,630
我是巴博萨船长 我今日来此

556
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:44,040
- 表达善意 - 我不需要什么善意
- with cordial intent. - I don't need any cordial intent.

557
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:48,210
你听到没 这个海盗想要释放善意
Do you hear that? This pirate wishes to be cordial.

558
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:52,050
我让你见识见识我的善意是什么
So let me show you what my cordiality is.

559
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:54,340
我每敲一次剑
Every time I tap my sword.

560
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:58,140
你的一名船员就会被杀掉 所以我建议你闲言少叙
One of your men will die, So I suggest you speak quickly.

561
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:04,600
船长你可能得说快点
Might want to go a bit faster Captain.

562
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:12,370
- 杰克·斯派洛在哪 - 杰克去寻找三叉戟了
- Where is Jack Sparrow? - Jack be sailing for the trident.

563
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:15,870
- 不 海洋是属于亡灵的 - 三叉戟控制着海洋

00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,880
能够救得了他 他和你都会死
I can't save him. He'll die as will you.

567
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,210
我是唯一一位能顾带你去找他的人
I be the only one that can lead you to him.

568
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:31,050
我保证你能在明天日出前取走杰克的性命

带我去找他 你就能活下来讲述这一切

我代表我的船员谢谢你

卡丽娜 我们没多少时间了
Carina, we haven't got much time,

575
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:11,800
亡灵们正朝我们驶来

576
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,090
- 是这样吗 - 是的 我和他们交谈过

你和他们交谈过
You spoken to them?

578
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:17,430
你是不是还和北海巨妖还有美人鱼说过话
Have you spoken to the Krakens and the mermaids as well?

579
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:18,970
北海巨妖不说话 是个人就知道
Krakens don't speak, everyone knows that.

580
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:21,770
当然 我就不该救你
Of course, I never should have saved you.

581
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:25,060
昨晚出现了血月 正如你描述的那样

你都让我托着你的走廊了 记得吗
You trusted me to hold your porch, remember?

585
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:30,900
那是我的船尾

586
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,860
显然你还需要多在海上磨练磨练
Clearly you need to spend more time at sea.

587

589
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:37,820
卡丽娜 那你为什么还要来找我
Then why did come to me Carina?

590
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,910
为什么我们被绑在一起在海上
Why are we tied together in the middle of the sea...

591
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:41,370
追寻同一份宝藏
Chasing the same treasure?

592
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:46,080
月亮揭示了一条线索
The moon revealed a clue...

593
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:48,460
要释放大海的力量

596
00:54:57,930 --> 00:54:59,390
那么我们就去找答案
Then we'll find out.

597
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:04,350
- 这个地图集里没有地图 - 把我的日记给我
- There is no map in this map. - Give me my diary.

598
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,900
把无人能阅的地图给我
Give me the map no man can read.

599
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:08,730
如果你能看得着
If you could read it.

600
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:10,320
那就不会被叫做无人能阅的地图了
Then it wouldn't be call the map that no man can read.

601
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,360
我拜托你 别和她争
I beg you please, don't argue with her.

602
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:14,940
这艘船上大部分的人都不识字
Most of the men on this ship can't read.

603
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:17,410
使得大部分的地图
Which makes all maps.

604
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:19,450
对他们来说都是无法阅读的地图
Maps that no man can read.

605
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:22,240
如果你读不了 那么你也就不需要它和我了
Well if you can't read it, then you've no use for it, or me.

606
00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:26,500
我重新说一遍 把地图给我看
Let me start again. Show me the map.

607
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:29,460
我不能 它根本不存在
I can't. It does not even exist.

608
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,710
- 她是个女巫 - 我是个星象家
- She's a witch! - I'm an astronomer.

609
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:37,180
- 她养驴子 - 什么 不是
- She breeds donkeys. - What? No.

610
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:40,890
- 星象家解读天象 - 是啊 在驴子上
- An astronomer contemplates the sky. - Yay, on a donkey.

611
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:44,640
- 不 没有驴子的事 - 那么你是怎么养它们的
- No, there's no donkey! - Well then how do you breed then?

612
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:49,140
让我简化一下这个交易 把地图给我
Allows me to simplify this equation. Give me the map.

613
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:56,360
不然我就杀了他 杀了他
Or I'll kill... him, or kill him.

614
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:01,490
来呀 你在虚张声势
Go on then. You're bluffing.

615
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:04,370
你脸红了
And you're blushing.

616
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,410
把他扔下海去
Throw him over.

617
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,960
我们管这叫做拖龙骨
We call this keel hauling.

618
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:17,170
小亨利会被扔下船去
Young Henry will be tossed over.

619
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:21,130
被拖在船底
And he will be dragged under the ship.

620
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:22,390
好吧
Alright.

621
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:25,310
- 你还在等什么 - 他好像没有在虚张声势
- What're you waiting for? - He doesn't appear to be bluff there.

622
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:29,180
不 我不虚张声势 他想说什么来着
No. Not bluffing me. He's trying to say something.

623
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:32,060
不 不 我们船上没有食物了 抱歉
No, no, we don't have any food on board. Sorry.

624
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:34,990
如果他走运的话 他会在
If he's lucky, he'll drown,

625
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:37,530
船底的藤壶把他切成肋排之前淹死
before the barnacles shred him to ribbon.

626
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:39,910
- 藤壶 - 像是上千把刀子
- Barnacles. - Like a thousands knives,

627
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:42,950
划过你的脊背 当然 血腥味儿会招来鲨鱼
across your back. And of course, the blood attracts sharks.

628
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:43,620
鲨鱼
Sharks?

629
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,200
- 船首有鲨鱼 - 在哪
- Shark of the bow! - Where?

630
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:49,540
我会说会不会游泳恐怕不是他最担心的问题了
I would say that swimming is no longer his primary concern.

631
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,210
地图在那
The map is there.

632
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:53,800
- 在哪 - 在你的手指尖上？
- Where? - On the tip of your finger?

633
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:56,210
不 在天上
No. In the heavens.

634
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,130
那本日记会把我引向
That dairy will lead me to a map,

635
00:56:58,210 --> 00:56:59,260
藏在群星之间的地图
hidden in the stars.

636
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:01,880
拉他上来吧 我今晚就能找到
Let him up, I'll find it tonight.

637
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:03,640
抱歉 拉不上来了
Sorry, can't bring him up.

638
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,050
你自己去看
Look for yourself.

639
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:10,930
就像我说的 脸红了
As I said... Blushing!

640
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:18,690
无耻的海盗
Filthy pirate!

641
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:26,750
大海被染成血色 一名被冲上岸的水手
The sea has turned to blood, a sailor washed ashore...

642
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:30,370
在说三叉戟的事 他之前在寻找杰克·斯派洛
Talking about the Trident. He was looking for Jack Sparrow.

643
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:33,330
那个将一位女巫从绞刑架上救下的海盗
The same pirate who saved a witch from the gallows.

644
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:36,750
- 她才不是女巫 - 但你是
- She's no Witch. - But you are.

645
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,050
- 而你要帮助我们 - 你害怕了吗 中尉
- And you're going to help us. - You afraid, Lieutenant?

646
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:46,640
风雨欲来 你想要知道你能不能自保
As ships burning the night, you want to know if you can save your own.

647
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:53,310
- 三叉戟是否存在 - 你要为我解读那面墙
- If the trident is real? - You are going to read that wall for me.

648
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,150
否则你会被处死 大英帝国
Or you will die. The British Empire will have...

649
00:57:56,230 --> 00:58:00,400
将会得到三叉戟并称霸海洋 我想要知道那个海盗
The trident and rule the sea. I want to know where that pirate is going,

650
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,820
带着那个女巫去哪了
with that witch.

651
00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:07,490
你的宿命就写在群星之中 我会为你设定航向
Your destiny is in these stars. I will set your course.

652
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:34,680
不要意面墙
No Spaghetti walls.

653
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:37,400
我干嘛费那个劲来找你
Why did I bother coming to you?

654
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,810
亡灵在追杀我们你却在这里无所事事
The dead are haunting us down and you do nothing.

655
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:43,490
- 无所事事 你管这叫无所事事 - 你喝得醉醺醺地呼呼大睡
- Nothing, You call this nothing? - You're drunk and you're sleeping.

656
00:58:43,570 --> 00:58:47,450
正是如此 我在一心二用
My point exactly, I am doing two things at once.

657
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:50,200
你没法解救不可救之人
You can't save the unsavable mate.

658
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:53,580
不管你喜欢与否 你都得帮助我
Like it or not Jack, you're going to help me.

659
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:55,620
我会打破我父亲的诅咒的
I will break my father's curse.

660
00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:00,340
下次你再挥剑的时候 小伙子
Next time you raise a sword, boy.

661
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:03,380
最好别死
Be the last to die.

662
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:23,480
我建议你奉承她两句讨好她
Might I suggest you entice her with a bit of flattery.

663
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:26,530
我来这是为了我的父亲 别无他求
I am here for my father, nothing more.

664
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:30,240
我知道 早就烂熟于心了
I knew it, absolutely smitten with that.

665
00:59:30,910 --> 00:59:34,370
勾搭棕发美女有一点注意事项
Now, bit of discretion when goes into brunette.

666
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:36,290
绝对不要追求她的姐妹
Never pursue her sister.

667
00:59:36,370 --> 00:59:39,790
如果你实在抵不住她姐妹的魅力
But if you can not avoid the charming sister.

668
00:59:40,290 --> 00:59:42,380
那就杀了哥哥 懂？
Kill the brother, savvy?

669
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:45,920
不 我不懂
No, I do not savvy.

670
00:59:47,970 --> 00:59:52,220
谁伤了你 顺便说一句刚才的一点经验之谈
Who hurt you? By the way that little slim of knowledge.

671
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:55,940
- 要25个先令 - 我才不会因为那个付你钱
- Has cost you five pieces. - I am not paying you for that.

672
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:57,770
也别对女人说种句话
Never say that to a woman.

673
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:15,950
你看不到不代表就不存在
Just because you can't see something does not mean it's not there.

674
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:18,540
比如地图吗
Like the map?

675
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:22,080
我们必须找到
We have to find it.

676
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:25,090
这是弄清我和我父亲
It's the only link to who I am.

677
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,510
身世的唯一线索
Who my father was.

678
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,180
所以我们这辈子
So we both spent our lives,

679
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:31,630
都花在了找寻我们的父亲上
searching for our fathers.

680
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:35,140
也许你我要比你想象的更为相似
Perhaps you and I are closer than you think.

681
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:54,490
太阳升起来了 所以是时候了
The sun is up. And so is up time.

682
01:00:57,370 --> 01:00:59,830
我无意辩驳 但是我们协议中的准确
I'm not to disagree, but the precision of our accord,

683
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:01,170
时间是太阳升起后
Ends at sunrise.

684
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:04,380
太阳才刚露头 离完全升起还早
This be will light, far from a fully rising sun.

685
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:08,010
- 我知道您是位信守诺言之人 - 诺言 你根本不了解我
- And I know you to be a man of honor. - Honor, you know nothing of me.

686
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:10,510
我知道被杰克·斯派洛打败是什么滋味
I know what it likes to be bested by Jack Sparrow.

687
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:13,930
- 他是我们共同的敌人 - 你并不知道我是谁
- He's an enemy to us both. - You don't know who I am.

688
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:20,180
我听说过一位强大的西班牙船长的故事 海上斗牛士
I've heard stories of a mighty Spanish captain. El Matador Del Mar.

689
01:01:20,350 --> 01:01:24,360
一位在海上纵横捭阖 追杀了成百上千的人
A man who skirts the sea. Hunted and killed thousands of men.

690
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:25,730
不 不 不 不是人
No, no, no. Men, no, no.

691
01:01:25,810 --> 01:01:26,820
不
No.

692
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,230
是海盗
Pirates! Eh?

693
01:01:31,570 --> 01:01:32,860
海盗
Pirates.

694
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:41,580
海盗世世代代为祸海洋
Pirates had infected the seas for generations.

695
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:44,920
夺去了我父亲和祖父的性命
Taken the life of my father and his father before.

696
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:48,590
因此我发誓要一劳永逸地除掉这个祸患
So I vowed to end this plague once and for all.

697
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:48,670


698
01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:52,090
我也是这么干的 我摧毁了许多海盗船
And that's what I did, I destroyed dozens of ships.

699
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:02,140
最后剩下的那些 集合起来 妄图打败我
The last ones joined together to try and defeat me.

700
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:05,230
但不久 他们也意识到 毫无希望
But they soon realized it was hopeless.

701
01:02:16,910 --> 01:02:19,530
没人能阻挡沉默玛丽号
Nothing could stop the Silent Mary.

702
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:22,370
在水面以下攻击
Hit them below the water line.

703
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:23,620
快 快
Vamo, vamo!

704
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:29,000
坚持住
Hang on tight!

705
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:41,220
海洋终于 纯净了
The sea was finally... pure.

706
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:45,690
卑鄙的海盗船不会再玷污海洋
Their wretched flags will no longer stain the sea.

707
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,820
他们在祈求饶恕
They are begging for mercy.

708
01:02:57,030 --> 01:03:00,300
怜悯？
Mercy?

709
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,540
绝不姑息
There's no mercy.

710
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:10,000
准备好
Make ready.

711
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:18,720
- 再见了！ - 开火！
- Adios! - Fire!

712
01:03:27,850 --> 01:03:30,060
现在就看你了 杰克
It's up to you now Jack.

713
01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:36,360
这个罗盘 指向你最想要的
This compass... points towards what you want most.

714
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:41,370
永远不要背叛它
Never betray it.

715
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:14,860
魔鬼三角洲
The Devil's Triangle.

716
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:20,910
他们最后的海盗船 在我眼前燃烧
The last of their ships were burning before my eyes.

717
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:26,580
就在 胜利时刻
And in that moment of... Victori.

718
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:28,830
就在那时 我听到了
It's when I heard it.

719
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:32,670
等一等 船长
Hold on, Captain.

720
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,170
有一条船想冲出烟雾逃跑
One ship was trying to escape through the smoke.

721
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:38,760
出海的好日子 对吧
It's a lovely day for a sail, ain't it?

722
01:04:38,970 --> 01:04:40,090
就在那里
And there.

723
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:45,480
在瞭望台 就是那个年轻的海盗
In the crow's nest, there was this young pirate boy.

724
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:47,850
在我看来 就只有我们两个了
The way I see it, it just the two of us left.

725
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:51,060
你要是现在投降 我就让你活 简单极了
If you surrender to me now, I'll let you live, simple.

726
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:54,440
他站在那里 就像 一只小鸟
He stood there, looking like. A little bird...

727
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:58,030
那天之后 他赢得了那个
And from that day he earned himself a name that would...

728
01:04:58,230 --> 01:05:00,570
纠缠我一辈子的名字
haunt me for the rest of my days.

729
01:05:02,450 --> 01:05:03,820
杰克·斯派洛
Jack de "Sparrow".

730
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:08,080
好啦 你现在投降 我就让你活
Right, you surrender to me now, and I'll let you live.

731
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:11,620
我可以让你活下来
I shall let you live.

732
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,090
这个男孩
This boy.

733
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:21,640
这个男孩居然嘲笑我的力量
This boy was mocking my power.

734
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:24,810
所以我就追上去 打定主意
So I test him. Knowing that I would run...

735
01:05:24,890 --> 01:05:29,560
要让我的刀已经划过他的脖子 当他死了 我就终于能...
My knife along his neck, and when he was dead, I would finish finally...

736
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:31,180
终结了所有的海盗
With pirates's life.

737
01:05:36,230 --> 01:05:37,360
追上去
Follow him men!

738
01:05:38,690 --> 01:05:41,280
大炮都推过来 拿一些缆绳
To the gutholes. Thread some lines.

739
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:45,240
准备急转
Prepare the boot leg!

740
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:46,410
左舷
Port side.

741
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:49,740
扔下去
Throw it now.

742
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:13,060
他们掉头了
They're turning around.

743
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,050
这都是什么
What's all this?

744
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:30,050
贡品 先生
Tribute... Sir.

745
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:01,790
他夺走了我的一切
He took everything from me.

746
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:05,550
让我充满 狂怒
And filled me with... rage.

747
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:09,590
和痛苦
And pain.

748
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:14,100
他就是传说的终结
And he is where the tale ends.

749
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,600
还没呢 船长 那里
Not yet Capitan, there.

750
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,230
我就说会找到的
Found as promised.

751
01:08:45,630 --> 01:08:47,340
她说自己有地图
So she's saying she's got the map,

752
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:48,890
但是她是唯一能看懂的
but she's the only one who can follow it?

753
01:08:48,970 --> 01:08:51,350
- 所以我们要 - 别管她
- So we should...? - Leave her be.

754
01:08:51,430 --> 01:08:54,020
- 她会带我们到三叉戟 - 你都说了几个小时了
- She will take us to the Trident. - You've been saying that for hours.

755
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:57,640
我们可以确信的有两件事 白天没有星星
Two things we know are true, the stars don't shine by day.

756
01:08:57,810 --> 01:08:59,560
还有 她忘了带驴子
And she forgot a donkey.

757
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:04,110
那我们怎么去一个地图上找不到的地方
How can we go to a spot, where no land exists on any map?

758
01:09:05,690 --> 01:09:08,360
这个航海经线仪跟伦敦时间一模一样
This chronometer keeps the exact time in London.

759
01:09:08,690 --> 01:09:10,370
我用它做海拔测量
I'm using it to make an altitude measurement...

760
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:11,950
来确定经度
To determine longitude.

761
01:09:12,530 --> 01:09:15,000
只有这样 我们才能找到确切的观测点
Only then will we find our exact spot to see.

762
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:17,620
所以你是打算用一个表来找到三叉戟
So you expect to find the trident with a timepiece?

763
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:18,750
对的
Yes.

764
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:21,580
我的计算十分准确
My calculations are precise and true.

765
01:09:21,870 --> 01:09:23,210
我不光是天文学家
I'm not only an Astronomer.

766
01:09:23,290 --> 01:09:24,790
我也是个钟表专家
I am also a horologist.

767
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:31,630
没什么丢人的
No shame in that dear.

768
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:35,100
大家都要糊口嘛
We'll all have to earn a living, eh?

769
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:39,560
不 我说我是钟表专家
No, I'm a horologist.

770
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:42,600
我妈也是啊 她也没有像你这样大声宣布
So was my mum. But she didn't cry a bad as lad as you.

771
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:45,150
你的意思是你妈也有一定学术研究背景吗
You saying your mother was academically inclined?

772
01:09:45,230 --> 01:09:49,650
不如说 平躺着的背景吧
More like a horizontally, reclined.

773
01:09:50,650 --> 01:09:52,950
钟表学是研究时间的
Horology is the study of time.

774
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:55,200
她也总在看时间啊
And she was always looking at watch.

775
01:09:55,450 --> 01:09:56,660
这点我敢保证
I can vouch for that.

776
01:09:58,490 --> 01:10:01,960
所以 只有你能找到宝藏 是么
So no one can find the X, but you, right?

777
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:02,830
不
No.

778
01:10:02,910 --> 01:10:05,170
- 还有驴子吗 - 后方有船
- And the donkey? - Ship to the f!

779
01:10:07,710 --> 01:10:08,710
萨拉查
Salazar.

780
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:15,600
杰克 亡灵在得到复仇之前是不会停下的
Jack, the dead will not rest until they get their revenge.

781
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:16,640
亡灵
Dead?

782
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:17,560
不 不 亡灵
No, no, the dead.

783
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:20,270
- 你没说有亡灵的事情 - 就不应该来
- Were never part of this deal. - We should've never follow.

784
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:22,520
跟着一个倒霉船长和女巫出海
A luck less pirate and a witch to sea.

785
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:24,390
不管了 把他们都杀了
Right, that's it. Kill them all.

786
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:28,270
杀了我 然后 然后我就死了
Kill me and, and... I will be dead.

787
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:32,780
那些亡灵就没法复仇了
And then the other dead won't be able to have the revenge.

788
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:35,160
对我复仇
Against me,

789
01:10:35,410 --> 01:10:36,990
- 我就死了 - 什么
- I'd be dead. - What?

790
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:38,950
- 他们将会更加愤怒 - 他说得对
- Which will anger them even more. - He's right.

791
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:39,780
说得对
That's right.

792
01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:41,710
海盗都这么没脑子么
Are all pirates this stupid?

793
01:10:41,790 --> 01:10:43,790
对的
Yes.

794
01:10:43,870 --> 01:10:45,500
那我们怎么办呢
What are we going to do?

795
01:10:46,290 --> 01:10:47,460
作为船长
As Captain.

796
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:50,340
我能建议下么
Might I suggest.

797
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,970
兵变 你非得建议兵变
Mutiny? You had to suggest a mutiny?

798
01:10:57,050 --> 01:10:58,550
卡丽娜 亡灵就要来了
Carina, the dead are coming.

799
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:01,980
反正 我是不相信什么超自然的屁话
Well. I choose not to believe in supernatural nonsense.

800
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:03,730
你难道没看到我们身后是什么
Do you not see what's behind us?

801
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:19,490
- 把它们放下去 - 遵命
- Drop them! - Si.

802
01:11:19,570 --> 01:11:20,830
放下去
Drop them!

803
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:28,840
你干什么
What are you doing?

804
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:30,380
船上的那些人在找杰克
Men on that ship are looking for Jack.

805
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:31,670
杰克在这条小船上
And Jack is on this boat.

806
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:32,960
我还是逃跑吧
I'm going to swim for it.

807
01:11:33,050 --> 01:11:35,880
你怎么敢学我
How dare you do exactly what I'd do if I were you?

808
01:11:36,010 --> 01:11:38,590
- 卡丽娜 别这样 - 不 不 不 千万别停
- Carina stop! - No, no, no, don't stop.

809
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:41,100
- 你够了 - 够什么够
- This has gone far enough. - No, it has not.

810
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:44,560
别听他的 接着脱 接着脱！
Listen not to him, carry on, carry on!

811
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:54,230
- 干嘛 眼看着要脱光了 - 我看到她的脚踝了
- Why, she was almost finished. - I saw her ankles.

812
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,860
你个傻小子要是闭嘴还能看到更多呢
You'd have to seen a lot more, if you kept the cakeholes shut.

813
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,670
去杀了斯派洛
Kill the sparrow.

814
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,320
这可不妙
That's not good, is it?

815
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:39,000
接着划 伙计 再快点！
Keep rowing man. Faster!

816
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:40,860
不 受够鸟
No, that's it.

817
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:43,320
我去找她了
I'm going with her.

818
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:47,420
你为了个光穿内衣的钟表专家就要抛弃我？
You would leave me for some horologist in her knickers?

819
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:48,500
没错
Yes.

820
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,670
臭男人都一个样
You men are all alike.

821
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:02,840
鲨鱼
Shark.

822
01:13:27,910 --> 01:13:29,000
亨利！
Henry!

823
01:13:51,350 --> 01:13:52,650
看来没用
Doesn't seem to be working.

824
01:13:52,730 --> 01:13:54,850
不 没事儿 没事儿的
No, we'll be fine, we'll be fine.

825
01:14:14,670 --> 01:14:16,750
- 这是怎么搞的 - 我们必须游泳了
- How did they do that? - We have to swim.

826
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:19,090
我来引开他
I will distract him.

827
01:14:24,590 --> 01:14:25,590
就现在
Now!

828
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:07,890
亨利
Henry!

829
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:01,360
嗨 杰克·斯派洛
Hi... Jack Sparrow.

830
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,070
杰克·斯派洛
Jack Sparrow.

831
01:16:05,150 --> 01:16:06,240
西班牙人
Spanish?

832
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:15,410
鬼魂
Ghosts.

833
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,290
他们无法登陆
They are unable to step on land.

834
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,920
- 我就知道 - 有鬼啊！
- I knew that. - Ghosts!

835
01:16:24,710 --> 01:16:28,010
- 卡丽娜 - 你很快就会为自己所做的付出代价
- Carina! - You will soon pay for what you did to me.

836
01:16:28,090 --> 01:16:30,470
不 不 不 真心不用麻烦了
No no no. There is no need to bother really.

837
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:32,220
- 卡丽娜 - 没空跟你聊
- Carina! - I have no time to chat.

838
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:36,100
- 因为我的地图要跑了 - 那我等着你
- Because mi map just ran away. - I'll be waiting for you.

839
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:39,690
等我干嘛 他为什么非要等我
Why would you be waiting for me? Why would he be waiting for me?

840
01:16:56,490 --> 01:16:57,660
有海盗
Pirates!

841
01:17:12,430 --> 01:17:13,430
史考姆
Scrum.

842
01:17:13,890 --> 01:17:14,760
船长
Captain?

843
01:17:14,850 --> 01:17:17,310
杰克说 如果他有什么意外
Jack always told me that if anything should ever happened to him.

844
01:17:17,390 --> 01:17:21,310
- 他要你当船长 - 但是大家支持你
- He wanted you to be captain. - Yes, but the men voted for you, yes?

845
01:17:21,390 --> 01:17:22,820
所以 你得到了船长的帽子
Well, you've got a captain's hat!

846
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:25,190
尽管如此 那是杰克的遗愿呢
"Be that as it may" them were his wishes.

847
01:17:25,270 --> 01:17:27,400
所以听话 去掌舵吧
So be a good lad and take the wheel.

848
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:28,610
还有你
And... you,

849
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:35,120
- 帽子归你了 - 哎呀妈呀 好荣幸
- Take the captain's hat. - Perish my rhythm.

850
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:39,870
我们要揍死你们的船长
We will beat your captain to death.

851
01:17:39,950 --> 01:17:41,920
除非他告诉我们他们去哪里了
Until he reveals where they are heading.

852
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:47,670
- 卡丽娜 - 我知道你纠结的是什么
- Carina! - I know what's ailing you boy.

853
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:49,880
你有个地方痒痒但是挠不到
You've got the unstretchable itch.

854
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:52,840
卡丽娜是唯一能带我们找到三叉戟的人
Carina is the only one who can help us find the Trident.

855
01:17:52,970 --> 01:17:55,140
- 我才没有爱上她 - 爱？
- And I'm not in love with her. - Love?

856
01:17:55,430 --> 01:17:57,430
谁说你爱了 你说什么呢？
Who said anything about love, what are you talking about?

857
01:17:57,510 --> 01:17:58,560
挠不到的痒痒
The unstretchable itch.

858
01:17:58,890 --> 01:18:00,940
疥疮 我说的是疥疮
Scabies, I'm talking about scabies.

859
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:03,270
皮肤下面的钻来钻去小虫子
Small mites that burrow under the skin.

860
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:05,480
烦死我了 都好几年了
Certainly annoying me, has done for years.

861
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:06,650
糟糕
Oh, no!

862
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:10,530
救命
Help!

863
01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:13,910
- 救救我 救命 - 卡丽娜
- Help me! Help! - Carina!

864
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:17,530
- 亨利 帮帮我 - 快帮她
- Henry, help me. - Help her!

865
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,460
奉天承运 国王诏曰
By rule of the King.

866
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:22,620
你们全被判处死刑
I sentence you all to death.

867
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:27,920
我们应该透露下彼此的私房钱藏哪里了
I think we should tell each other where our treasures are buried...

868
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,970
万一谁幸存了可以交给他
Just in case one of us survives.

869
01:18:29,970 --> 01:18:30,050


870
01:18:30,050 --> 01:18:31,300
好主意
Oh, good idea.

871
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:34,930
- 你先说 - 我的宝藏被埋在
- You go first. - My treasure is buried...

872
01:18:35,010 --> 01:18:37,430
阿鲁巴岛上两颗交叉的棕榈树下为标记的墓地
Between two cross palm trees in an unmarked grave in Aruba.

873
01:18:37,510 --> 01:18:39,850
你的宝藏呢
What about yours?

874
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:42,350
我没有宝藏
I haven't got any.

875
01:18:42,430 --> 01:18:44,110
你答应我杀死杰克的
You promised me Jack's blood.

876
01:18:44,190 --> 01:18:45,560
但杰克被困住了
But Jack is trapped!

877
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:49,320
- 他永远逃不出去了 - 再小也是陆地！
- He can never escape the island. - Piece of land!

878
01:18:55,570 --> 01:18:56,570
你们好
Hello.

879
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:02,660
我遵守了约定
I upheld our deal.

880
01:19:02,790 --> 01:19:04,580
我和手下会上岸去
Mi men and myself will go ashore.

881
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:06,830
我会把叛徒交还给你
The traitor will be yours.

882
01:19:07,170 --> 01:19:09,090
- 以我的名誉发誓 - 名誉
- On mi honor. - Honor?

883
01:19:09,670 --> 01:19:11,670
你这个家伙有何名誉可言
What honor, hombre? What honor?

884
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:14,380
- 你根本不懂名誉 - 请绕我一命
- You don't know what the honor is. - Spare mi my life.

885
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:17,050
我会把你要的小矮子斯派洛带来
And I'll fetch you little Sparrow.

886
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:20,810
同意吗
An accord?

887
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:38,620
醒醒 斯派洛
Wake up Sparrow.

888
01:19:41,950 --> 01:19:44,700
醒醒 斯派洛
Wake up Sparrow.

889
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:48,080
醒醒 斯派洛
Wake up, Sparrow.

890
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:52,420
- 是时候还债了 - 猪哥
- It's time to pay your debt. - Pig?

891

- 我的老伙计 - 伙计
- Mi old mate. - Mate?

893
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,510
孩子们听到没
Do you hear that boys?

894
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:04,440
这个海盗欠我一大笔银子
This pirate owes me a blunder of silver.

895
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:07,480
老天爷将他带到了刽子湾
And luck has brought him to Hangman's Bay.

896
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:10,560
在这他能还清欠款 从此两清
Where he can settle his debt, here and now.

897
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:14,530
我会的 猪哥 你说个数吧
And I will, I will Pig. Name your price.

898
01:20:14,610 --> 01:20:17,400
她叫碧翠丝
Her name is Beatrice.

899
01:20:20,370 --> 01:20:22,910
她是我可怜的寡妇妹妹
And she is my poor widowed sister.

900
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:27,040
啊 那是什么玩意啊
What, what is that?

901
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,040
她一直在找好男人
She's been looking for a respectable man.

902
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,590
- 但你也勉强可以了 - 罗伊斯 赶紧开始吧
- But you'll have to do. - Royce, let's get on with this.

903
01:20:32,710 --> 01:20:34,460
不 为什么 为什么非？...
No why? Why?...

904
01:20:34,550 --> 01:20:37,050
让她做回女人 对她好 杰克
To make an honest woman of her, Jack.

905
01:20:37,130 --> 01:20:39,880
恭喜你 今天你要结婚了
Congratulations, it's your wedding day.

906
01:20:41,180 --> 01:20:42,100
可以开始了吗
Let us begin?

907
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:44,970
我们会在谷仓中度蜜月
We will honeymoon in the barn.

908
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:51,820
不 别这样 猪哥
No, no, no. Pig.

909
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:55,070
我怎么可能真心实意地对它好呢
How can I honestly make an honest woman out of it?

910
01:20:55,150 --> 01:20:57,030
她 我的意思是她
That, her. I mean. Her.

911
01:21:00,740 --> 01:21:03,280
- 这玩意都是什么 - 我们的子嗣
- What are those things? - Our children.

912
01:21:03,910 --> 01:21:06,080
最好别和他们对视
Best not look them in the eye.

913
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:08,330
带伴娘伴郎来
Bring the best man and the bridesmaid.

914
01:21:09,790 --> 01:21:11,090
我看它的眼睛了
I looked it in the eye.

915
01:21:11,170 --> 01:21:13,420
将手放在圣经上
Place your hand on the Bible.

916
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:16,250
- 我有疥疮 - 巧了 我也有
- I have got scabies. - So do I.

917
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:19,420
手放在圣经上
Place your hand on the Bible.

918
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:21,430
我爱尿炕
I'm a bed wetter.

919
01:21:21,890 --> 01:21:23,300
说你愿意
Say I do.

920
01:21:24,390 --> 01:21:27,560
- 否则我爆了你的头 - 杰克 他们真要杀死我们
- Or I'll put a bullet in your skull. - Jack, they are going to kill us.

921
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:29,230
- 我不在乎 - 快同意吧
- I don't care! - Just say I do.

922
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:32,020
- 最后机会 - 等下 当然
- Last chance Jack. - Wait. Surely...

923
01:21:32,270 --> 01:21:34,860
- 这并不合法 - 不合法
- This is not legal. - This is not legal.

924
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:36,320
他说得对
He's right.

925
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,820
在场有人反对这桩婚姻吗？
Does any man here object to the nuptials?

926
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,990
- 我 - 恭喜
- I do. - Congratulations.

927
01:21:42,070 --> 01:21:43,620
你可以亲吻新娘了
You may kiss the bride.

928
01:21:56,090 --> 01:21:59,210
你爱吃海鲜 对吧？
Do you like seafood, do you?

929
01:22:02,630 --> 01:22:04,930
杰克 又见面了
Jack. We meet again.

930
01:22:06,010 --> 01:22:07,140
赫克托
Hector!

931
01:22:07,430 --> 01:22:09,940
这是我全世界最好的朋友
This is mi best mate in the whole world.

932
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:12,730
我一直知道你早晚会安心结婚
I always knew you'll settle down, eventually.

933
01:22:12,810 --> 01:22:14,190
你给我带礼物了吗
Did you bring me a gift?

934
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:17,730
这样也行
That'll do.

935
01:22:20,110 --> 01:22:23,660
你看着很精神 脚步十分轻盈
You look marvelous. Got quite a spring in your step.

936
01:22:24,740 --> 01:22:26,070
你的腿长出来了吗
Has your leg grown back?

937
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:28,540
船长 我们不该回去找萨拉查
Captain, shouldn't we be getting back to Salazar.

938
01:22:28,830 --> 01:22:31,200
用斯派洛先生的命换我们的吗？
Trade Mr. Sparrow's life in for our own?

939
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:35,540
可以那么做 但我是来找波塞冬三叉戟的
I know that we could. But I've come for the Trident Poseidon.

940
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:38,090
你要出卖那帮亡灵吗？
You're gonna double cross the dead?

941
01:22:38,170 --> 01:22:39,250
你向他们承诺过
You did promise!

942
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:43,380
所以我会摧毁偷走我对大海控制权的亡灵
And with it I'll gut the dead that stole my command of the sea.

943
01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:45,550
虽然我很喜欢这个计划
As much as I love this plan.

944
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:49,430
什么船都逃不脱那凄惨可悲的船的魔掌
No vessel can outrun that wretched haul of the ship.

945
01:22:49,510 --> 01:22:51,100
有的 杰克
But there be one, Jack.

946
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:52,560
我见过的最快的船
The fastest ship I know.

947
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:56,520
黑珍珠号 被困在黑胡子的瓶子里
The pearl, trapped in that bottle by Blackbeard.

948
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,270
五个寒冬前
Five winters ago.

949
01:23:00,150 --> 01:23:03,190
以强盗至高无上的剑起誓
By the power of that blaggerd sovereign blade...

950
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:08,780
我在此返还黑珍珠号曾经应得的荣耀
I hereby release the Black Pearl, to her former and rightful glory.

951
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:21,050
弄掉那
Get rid of the...

952
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:24,550
要来了
It's coming.

953
01:23:24,630 --> 01:23:26,550
它要出现了 来了来了
It is coming! It is coming! Coming!

954
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:33,980
放一边
Set aside.

955
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:36,900
要来了
It's coming!

956
01:23:52,580 --> 01:23:54,080
缩水了
It's shrunken.

957
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:56,370
为什么不能恢复原样呢
Why doesn't it unshrink?

958
01:23:57,370 --> 01:23:58,960
也许天太冷了
Maybe it's cold.

959
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:00,630
她要回到海上
She needs the sea.

960
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:16,560
她曾经是艘好船
She was a fine ship.

961
01:24:55,140 --> 01:24:57,770
船上只需要一位船长
There be room for only one captain.

962
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:03,980
- 肮脏的畜生 - 该去与亡灵赛跑了
- Filthy beast. - Time to race the dead.

963
01:25:10,780 --> 01:25:12,990
唯一安全的地方就是陆地
The only safe place is the land.

964
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:14,910
为什么我们要离开陆地
Why are we going away from the land?

965
01:25:15,370 --> 01:25:16,370
没人知道吗
Nobody knows?

966
01:25:16,910 --> 01:25:19,290
船长 你的地图不完整
Captain, your map is incomplete.

967
01:25:19,580 --> 01:25:22,330
如果你相信我 我能带大家去找三叉戟
I can take us to the Trident, if you'd only trust me.

968
01:25:23,330 --> 01:25:25,500
你听我刚才说的了吗
Did you not hear anything I just said?

969
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:27,010
所以你的意思是
So you be saying.

970
01:25:27,090 --> 01:25:29,590
那颗星星假装自己是地图吗
Is that star pretending to be a map?

971
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:32,140
船长 任何地图上都没有陆地
Sir, there is no island, on any map,

972
01:25:32,220 --> 01:25:34,100
那女人说的毫无根据
to support what the woman says.

973
01:25:34,180 --> 01:25:36,010
船长 你不用理解她说的话
Captain, you don't have to understand her.

974
01:25:36,180 --> 01:25:37,640
只需要相信她
Just believe her.

975
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:40,190
有人吗？
Any one?

976
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:55,660
要是有锋利的东西 我就能撬锁
We had something sharp, I could pick that lock.

977
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:59,040
在这里你绝对找不到锋利的玩意
You are not gonna find anything sharp in here.

978
01:26:21,430 --> 01:26:22,480
放了他们
Release them.

979
01:26:24,730 --> 01:26:29,110
船长 你不会想让女人掌舵吧
Sir, you wouldn't allow a woman to steer your ship?

980
01:26:29,190 --> 01:26:32,400
让她去追星星 否则我们都会死
She will follow her star. Or we'll all die together.

981
01:26:52,050 --> 01:26:55,010
黑珍珠号 又起航了
The Black Pearl. She sails again.

982
01:26:58,140 --> 01:27:00,770
这艘船 那些鬼
This ship. Those ghosts.

983
01:27:01,770 --> 01:27:03,520
都无法用常理来解释
There can be no logical explanation.

984
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,650
海之传说是真的 卡丽娜
Myths of the sea are real, Carina.

985
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:08,020
很高兴你终于能意识到自己想错了
I'm glad you can finally see you were wrong.

986
01:27:08,150 --> 01:27:09,150
错
Wrong?

987
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:12,570
也许我确实怀疑过
Perhaps I had some doubts.

988
01:27:12,650 --> 01:27:14,530
这是我听过最糟的道歉了
This is the worst apology I've ever heard.

989
01:27:14,610 --> 01:27:16,360
道歉 我为什么要道歉
Apology? Why would I apologize?

990
01:27:16,450 --> 01:27:18,620
因为我们在被亡灵追捕 开一艘
Because we've been chased by the dead, sailing on a ship,

991
01:27:18,700 --> 01:27:20,870
从瓶子里蹦出的船 科学如何解释
raised from a bottle. Where is your science in that?

992
01:27:20,950 --> 01:27:23,370
好吧 我会道歉
Fine, I will apologize.

993
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:24,830
接着说
Go on, then.

994
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:26,920
那样的话 你可能也要和我道歉
Well then, one could argue that you owe me an apology.

995
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,710
我的生命因为你被海盗与亡灵威胁
As my life has been threatened by pirates and dead man.

996
01:27:29,790 --> 01:27:31,960
现在你相信了 虽然这么说很欠打
Which you now believe in, sorry to say.

997
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:33,550
我原谅你
Apology accepted.

998
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,140
我去望风
I am going to the lookout.

999
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:39,430
很高兴你这么想
I'm glad you see it my way!

1000
01:27:48,980 --> 01:27:51,650
- 准备好枪 - 准备好枪
- Ready the guns. - Aye. Ready the guns!

1001
01:27:51,730 --> 01:27:53,820
这些海盗是冲着三叉戟来的
These pirates are going for the trident.

1002
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:10,630
这你是从哪拿到的 姑娘
Where did you get that from Missy?

1003
01:28:11,290 --> 01:28:14,380
我知道这本书 十多年前
I know this book, stolen from an Italian ship,

1004
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:16,630
- 从意大利船上偷的 - 偷
- many years ago. - Stolen?

1005
01:28:17,010 --> 01:28:18,260
不 你看认错了
No, you're mistaken.

1006
01:28:18,340 --> 01:28:20,140
书封皮上本有一颗红宝石
There was a Ruby on the cover...

1007
01:28:20,220 --> 01:28:22,260
非常记忆犹新
I would not soon forget.

1008
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:27,360
这是我父亲给我的
This was given to me by my father.

1009
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:29,560
他明明是个科学家
He was clearly a man of science.

1010
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:33,690
显然他是个小偷
He was clearly a common thief.

1011
01:28:35,110 --> 01:28:37,030
我对父亲的回忆
The memory of my father will not be befouled...

1012
01:28:37,110 --> 01:28:38,660
才不会被海盗之舌玷污
by the tongue of a pirate.

1013
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:41,200
这本日记是我生来就有的
This diary is my birth right.

1014
01:28:41,570 --> 01:28:43,740
被放在儿童之家的台阶上
Left to me on the steps of a children's home.

1015
01:28:44,330 --> 01:28:46,080
还留了一个名字 仅此而已
Along with a name and nothing else.

1016
01:28:46,370 --> 01:28:48,160
所以你是孤儿咯
Oh, so you are an orphan?

1017
01:28:49,210 --> 01:28:50,630
你叫什么
What be you called?

1018
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:55,050
北方的明亮之星赋予我名字
Brightest star in the North gave me my name.

1019
01:29:01,850 --> 01:29:05,100
- 所以你叫卡丽娜 - 卡丽娜·史密斯
- That would be Carina? - Carina Smyth.

1020
01:29:06,980 --> 01:29:11,100
- 你确实很了解星象 - 我是船长
- So, you do know your stars? - I'm a captain.

1021
01:29:14,570 --> 01:29:17,400
我知道跟着哪颗星星能回家
I know which stars to follow home.

1022
01:30:00,530 --> 01:30:01,860
史密斯
Smyth?

1023
01:30:02,860 --> 01:30:05,330
史密斯十个不同寻常的姓
Smyth is quite an unusual name.

1024
01:30:06,530 --> 01:30:10,080
我们不也认识一位吗 老史密斯
Did we not once know someone, old Smyth?

1025
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:11,460
别捣乱
Shut your trip.

1026
01:30:11,580 --> 01:30:13,080
她叫什么来着
What was her name.

1027
01:30:13,670 --> 01:30:15,460
到嘴边了就是想不出
It's right on the tip of mi tongue...

1028
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,590
你想丢掉舌头吗
Do you wanna loose that tongue?

1029
01:30:17,670 --> 01:30:18,760
玛格丽特·史密斯
Margaret Smyth.

1030
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:22,380
我们达成一致了吗
Aye, so we making accord then?

1031
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:25,300
还是我去告诉那个人
Or, Shall I tell you know who...

1032
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:27,850
我们都知道真相
What we both know it's the truth.

1033
01:30:27,930 --> 01:30:30,400
你我要把这个秘密带入坟墓
We both take the secret to our grave.

1034
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:32,270
所以是真的咯 我只是在虚张声势
You mean, it is true? I was bluffing.

1035
01:30:32,350 --> 01:30:33,150
才不是
I am not!

1036
01:30:33,230 --> 01:30:36,520
杀了我 你就没东西给亡灵了
You kill me, you got nothing to bow to the deadness.

1037
01:30:36,980 --> 01:30:38,780
你需要我
So you need me.

1038
01:30:39,860 --> 01:30:44,580
必须坦白 赫克托 你真的非常非常丑
I will have to frank Hector. You are very, very ugly.

1039
01:30:44,660 --> 01:30:48,990
你怎么会生出那么位可人呢？
So how could you produce a fetching creature such as that?

1040
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:51,200
玛格丽特死了
Margaret died.

1041
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:54,370
我尽了一个不成器的强盗最大的努力
That worthless blaggerd ever could.

1042
01:30:54,370 --> 01:30:54,750


1043
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:58,340
我把还是婴儿的她送进孤儿院 不曾回去看她
I placed the infant in an orphanage, never to see her again.

1044
01:30:58,590 --> 01:31:01,340
我以为留下红宝石可以让她过得好一点
I thought the ruby might afford her some easy life...

1045
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:03,880
没想到她会去研究那本日记
But I never imagined she would take those scribblings...

1046
01:31:04,130 --> 01:31:05,720
想要解开身世之谜
Make a life of her own.

1047
01:31:07,010 --> 01:31:09,140
还是回到了我身边
Life that's led her back to me.

1048
01:31:11,890 --> 01:31:16,940
看来现在情况对我非常有利 老爹
I would say this puts me in a rather favorable position, Daddy.

1049
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:19,520
- 要什么你说 - 我要我的罗盘
- Tell me what you want. - I want mi compass.

1050
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:25,740
还有216桶的兰姆酒和这只猴子
216 barrels of rum. And a monkey.

1051
01:31:26,490 --> 01:31:28,450
- 你想养杰克 - 晚餐
- You want Jack? - Dinner.

1052
01:31:28,530 --> 01:31:30,490
我要把它当晚餐吃掉
I want to eat him. I want to eat that monkey.

1053
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:33,920
不行杰克 这么聪明的姑娘
No deal Jack. A clever young woman such as that,

1054
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:38,330
是绝对不会相信我这样的人会是她的父亲
would never believe that a swine like me could ever be her blood.

1055
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:43,590
而且我一定要得到三叉戟
And the Tridente will be mine.

1056
01:31:54,350 --> 01:31:55,690
皇家海军
Redcoats.

1057
01:31:56,980 --> 01:31:58,230
皇家海军来了
Redcoats!

1058
01:32:01,150 --> 01:32:03,280
准备射击
Prepare to fire!

1059
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:04,990
准备射击
Prepare to fire.

1060
01:32:11,990 --> 01:32:14,250
敌军从右弦那边摸过来了
She comes starboard.

1061
01:32:14,830 --> 01:32:16,790
我们要奋战到底
We shall fight to the last.

1062
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:20,130
黑珍珠号绝不能再次被夺走
The pearl will not be taken from me again...

1063
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:26,050
长官
Sir.

1064
01:32:30,930 --> 01:32:34,520
海上的控制权只能属于大英帝国
Only the British Empire will hold the power of the sea.

1065
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:12,050
不论发生什么事 只管保持航线
What ever happens, stay your course.

1066
01:33:37,870 --> 01:33:42,550
杰克·斯派洛
Jack Sparrow?

1067
01:33:42,630 --> 01:33:44,880
我来找你算账了
I've come with the butcher's bill.

1068
01:33:49,340 --> 01:33:50,590
他人呢
Where is he?

1069
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:57,970
大家准备战斗 跟他们拼了
Defend yourselves men! Till again!

1070
01:33:59,810 --> 01:34:03,560
能不能快点 你这刀子是用黄油磨出来的吗
Hurry up man, what did you... sharpen it with butter?

1071
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:26,040
看你往哪儿躲
There is nowhere to hide.

1072
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:44,400
勇敢起来 让我们为黑珍珠号而战
Let's be brave, save the Pearl.

1073
01:34:53,700 --> 01:34:55,070
就是这里
This has to be it.

1074
01:34:58,120 --> 01:35:00,750
- 应该在这里 - 往那片陆地上开
- It has to be here. - Sail that land.

1075
01:35:00,830 --> 01:35:02,750
我的天
Oh mi Lord's eye.

1076
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,330
快到了
We're nearly there.

1077
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:06,880
应该就在附近
It's here somewhere.

1078
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:30,130
找到那地方了吗 小姐
Have you found what you were looking for yet, miss?

1079
01:36:30,210 --> 01:36:31,460
我正在找
I'm trying!

1080
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,430
星星就要看不见了
The stars will soon be gone.

1081
01:37:07,620 --> 01:37:08,620
卡丽娜
Carina!

1082
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:12,290
亨利 你看 小岛就在那里
Henry! Look, the island is there.

1083
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:14,250
你找到了
You found it!

1084
01:37:24,970 --> 01:37:26,060
那座岛
The island.

1085
01:37:31,860 --> 01:37:32,940
陆地
Land!

1086
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:35,730
快去
Get to the...

1087
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:53,330
卡丽娜
Carina!

1088
01:38:09,430 --> 01:38:10,890
卡丽娜
Carina!

1089
01:38:13,940 --> 01:38:15,320
亨利
Henry!

1090
01:38:28,870 --> 01:38:29,870
他们抓走了亨利
They took Henry!

1091
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:32,500
现在只有三叉戟才能救他
The trident be all that can save him now.

1092
01:38:32,710 --> 01:38:34,170
那么我们一定要找到三叉戟
Then we have to find it.

1093
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:55,440
三叉戟在哪里
Where is it?

1094
01:39:00,110 --> 01:39:01,530
一定在这里
It has to be here.

1095
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:34,890
快来看 杰克
Look at it Jack.

1096
01:39:35,810 --> 01:39:38,150
我从没见过这么漂亮的东西
It's most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

1097
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:40,740
这是父亲希望我找到的
This is what my father wanted to find.

1098
01:39:40,820 --> 01:39:41,740
石头吗
The rocks?

1099
01:39:41,820 --> 01:39:44,900
不不是石头 是星星
No, no. Not rocks, stars.

1100
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:47,570
它就是无人能懂的海图指引的地方
This is the map no man can read.

1101
01:39:48,950 --> 01:39:53,000
整座岛是天堂的完美倒影
This island is a perfect reflection of the heavens.

1102
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:03,210
少了一颗星星 快来
One star's missing, quickly.

1103
01:40:04,340 --> 01:40:06,510
我们必须找三叉戟才能救亨利
We have to find the trident to save Henry.

1104
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:07,720
赫克托
Hector.

1105
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:09,850
你应该知道她是个钟表专家
I think you should know she's a horologist.

1106
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:39,330
它为什么不在闪烁
Why is not it glowing?

1107
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:42,550
把它放回原位 卡丽娜
Finish it, Carina.

1108
01:40:49,090 --> 01:40:50,350
丢失的那一角
The missing star.

1109
01:40:52,140 --> 01:40:53,520
为了我的父亲
For my father.

1110
01:40:54,970 --> 01:40:56,060
没错
Aye...

1111
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:58,650
为了他
Do it for him.

1112
01:42:29,940 --> 01:42:30,950
看
There.

1113
01:42:31,820 --> 01:42:34,990
- 波塞冬之墓 - 这边
- Posiedon's tomb. - This way.

1114
01:42:38,290 --> 01:42:39,120
船长
Capitan.

1115
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:41,000
你知道这很危险的 别那么做
You know the danger. Don't do it!

1116
01:42:41,210 --> 01:42:44,050
没别的办法了 杰克已经上岸去找三叉戟了
We have no choice. Jack is on land going for the trident.

1117
01:42:44,130 --> 01:42:45,710
船长 一定有别的办法的
Capitan, there must be another way.

1118
01:42:45,790 --> 01:42:47,000
一旦你附身活人
Once you possess the living,

1119
01:42:47,090 --> 01:42:49,680
就再也回不来了 你会困在他身体里面
there is no coming back. You will be trapped in his body.

1120
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:50,760
直到永远
Forever.

1121
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:52,590
三叉戟能还我自由的
The Tridente will set me free.

1122
01:42:55,640 --> 01:42:58,350
- 是时候去杀斯派洛了 - 不
- Time to kill a sparrow. - No!

1123
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:15,410
- 快看 杰克 就在那 - 三叉戟
- Look Jack, there it is. - The trident.

1124
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:23,500
杰克！
Jack!

1125
01:44:01,790 --> 01:44:04,040
你伤了我就等于伤了亨利
You cut me, you cut the boy Jack.

1126
01:44:39,820 --> 01:44:41,740
- 亨利！- 不
- Henry! - No.

1127
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:15,500
又见面啦 斯派洛
Hola, Sparrow.

1128
01:45:16,650 --> 01:45:17,650
不
No.

1129
01:45:29,370 --> 01:45:32,130
斯派洛 斯派洛
Sparrow, Sparrow.

1130
01:45:33,420 --> 01:45:35,510
不
No.

1131
01:45:39,630 --> 01:45:42,970
亨利 把他唤醒拜托
Henry, you've woken him up Please.

1132
01:45:43,220 --> 01:45:44,390
亨利快醒醒
Henry wake up!

1133
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:47,930
滚开
Oh, piss off!

1134
01:45:57,740 --> 01:45:59,570
亨利快醒醒 他要杀杰克
Henry wakes up, he is killing Jack.

1135
01:46:10,580 --> 01:46:11,580
亨利
Henry!

1136
01:46:12,170 --> 01:46:13,960
- 大海之力 - 什么
- Power of the sea. - What?

1137
01:46:14,630 --> 01:46:18,210
- 大海之力 - 要释放大海之力
- The power of the sea. - To release the power of the sea...

1138
01:46:18,630 --> 01:46:19,920
必须分离
All must divide.

1139
01:46:26,390 --> 01:46:28,350
如果三叉戟掌握着所有的力量 那么
If the trident holds all the power, then.

1140
01:46:28,430 --> 01:46:30,060
那么所有的诅咒都会存在其中
Then every curse is held inside.

1141
01:46:31,060 --> 01:46:32,980
就像我之前告诉你的那样
As I told you before.

1142
01:46:33,190 --> 01:46:36,190
现在向我投降 我就不会
Surrender to me now. And I will let you.

1143
01:46:37,150 --> 01:46:40,110
- 杀你 - 你想让我投降？
- Live. - Do you want me to surrender?

1144
01:46:42,240 --> 01:46:45,580
- 也许 - 审判到此结束
- Maybe. - This is where the trail ends.

1145
01:46:47,990 --> 01:46:49,120
不要
No!

1146
01:47:02,220 --> 01:47:03,220
分离
Divide.

1147
01:47:03,470 --> 01:47:04,550
亨利
Henry!

1148
01:47:06,850 --> 01:47:08,060
分离
Divide.

1149
01:47:08,140 --> 01:47:08,640
破坏
Break.

1150
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:11,230
打破三叉戟就能破坏大海的诅咒
Break the trident and you'll break off the curses of the sea.

1151
01:47:11,310 --> 01:47:13,560
拜拜了 斯派洛
Adios, Sparrow.

1152
01:47:59,270 --> 01:48:00,820
所有的诅咒都消除了
All curses have broken.

1153
01:48:09,660 --> 01:48:10,950
太好了
Yes!

1154
01:48:41,020 --> 01:48:44,360
- 黑珍珠号 我的黑珍珠号 - 快爬
- The Pearl! My Pearl! - Climb.

1155
01:48:44,610 --> 01:48:46,910
快走
Move, fast!

1156
01:48:50,370 --> 01:48:53,290
开稳了伙计们 别让它滑下去
Hold it steady boys, don't let it slip.

1157
01:48:58,290 --> 01:48:59,830
杰克！
Jack!

1158
01:49:02,710 --> 01:49:04,170
快点！
Faster!

1159
01:49:16,730 --> 01:49:19,100
起锚
Lift, anchor!

1160
01:49:19,400 --> 01:49:21,400
快起锚
Get the anchor up, quick!

1161
01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:22,240
停下停下 起锚
Stop, stop, bring it up.

1162
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:24,690
快起锚
Bring it up!

1163
01:49:42,130 --> 01:49:45,090
船长
Capitan!

1164
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:11,870
该死
Oh, crap!

1165
01:50:33,180 --> 01:50:34,680
我抓住你了
I've got ya.

1166
01:50:56,530 --> 01:50:58,370
我对你来说是什么？
Who am I to you?

1167
01:51:01,080 --> 01:51:02,620
宝藏
Treasure.

1168
01:51:13,300 --> 01:51:14,390
抓住了
Hold on!

1169
01:51:18,220 --> 01:51:19,350
赫克托
Hector!

1170
01:52:34,760 --> 01:52:36,380
去右舷
Go to starboard!

1171
01:53:02,240 --> 01:53:04,200
这是海盗的宿命 赫克托
Pirate's life, Hector.

1172
01:53:40,490 --> 01:53:41,530
你还好吧？
You were right?

1173
01:53:43,240 --> 01:53:44,330
说不清
I don't know.

1174
01:53:44,950 --> 01:53:47,210
有一瞬间我像是拥有了一切，亨利
For a moment I had everything, Henry.

1175
01:53:49,460 --> 01:53:51,130
但现在又全没了
Now it's all gone again.

1176
01:53:51,330 --> 01:53:53,880
没有全都失去 史密斯小姐
It's not all gone, Miss. Smyth.

1177
01:54:07,270 --> 01:54:11,770
巴博萨 我姓巴博萨
Barbarossa... My name is Barbarossa.

1178
01:54:53,770 --> 01:54:56,780
- 也许杰克说的没错 - 说什么
- Maybe Jack was right. - About what?

1179
01:54:57,530 --> 01:54:59,320
你是难挠之痒
You unstretchable itch.

1180
01:55:02,990 --> 01:55:04,370
你为什么打我
Why did you do that for?

1181
01:55:04,450 --> 01:55:06,200
看看是不是真的你
Just checking it's truly you.

1182
01:55:06,450 --> 01:55:08,080
我怕你又被附身
That you are not still cursed.

1183
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,380
- 是真的我 - 那是我
- It's me. - Then I was...

1184
01:55:11,460 --> 01:55:13,830
- 错了 - 小失误
- Wrong. - Slightly an error.

1185
01:55:14,290 --> 01:55:15,420
不过
Although one.

1186
01:55:21,970 --> 01:55:23,470
我原谅你了
Apology accepted.

1187
01:55:37,110 --> 01:55:38,570
是荷兰人号
The Dutchman.

1188
01:56:14,020 --> 01:56:17,190
- 亨利？- 是我 老爸
- Henry? - Yes father.

1189
01:56:26,030 --> 01:56:27,990
看看你 长这么大了
Oh, look at you son.

1190
01:56:32,450 --> 01:56:33,750
你怎么做到的？
How did you do it?

1191
01:56:35,790 --> 01:56:38,540
- 你怎么打破诅咒的？- 让我给你讲个故事
- How did you break the curse? - Let me tell you a tale.

1192
01:56:39,250 --> 01:56:41,710
人类史上最伟大宝藏的故事
The tale of the greatest treasure known to man.

1193
